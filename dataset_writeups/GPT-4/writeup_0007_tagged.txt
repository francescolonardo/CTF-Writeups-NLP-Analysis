Title: XML External Entity (XXE) Attack to Access Sensitive Files
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: XML External Entity (XXE) Attack
Tools used: None
Keywords: XML, import, export, vulnerability, malicious, external entity, sensitive files, server, /etc/passwd, error message, flag, challenge

#overview
During a CTF event, the author discovered a web application that allowed users to import and export data using XML files. The author suspected that this functionality could be exploited to gain access to sensitive files on the server through an XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability.

#analysis
To test for an XXE vulnerability, the author crafted a malicious XML file that included an external entity pointing to a sensitive file on the server, such as /etc/passwd. The XML file was uploaded using the import feature provided by the web application. Upon processing the XML file, the application returned an error message that included the contents of the /etc/passwd file, confirming the presence of an XXE vulnerability. The author was then able to exploit the XXE vulnerability further and access other sensitive files on the server, ultimately obtaining the flag required for the Web Exploitation challenge.

#attack_execution
The author's successful exploitation of the XXE vulnerability demonstrates the importance of securing XML parsers and properly handling user-supplied XML files in web applications. By exploiting the XXE vulnerability, the author was able to access sensitive server files and obtain the flag needed to complete the challenge.
