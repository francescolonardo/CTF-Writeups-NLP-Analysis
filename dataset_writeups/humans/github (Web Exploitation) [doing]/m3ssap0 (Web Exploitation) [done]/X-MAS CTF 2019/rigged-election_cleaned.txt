With the website you can submit an idea. An ID is assigned to that idea and the idea can be voted.

The JavaScript into `index.js` contains the voting procedure, it requires that a sort of challenge is returned by the server after the first request, and then the client has to find a string which produces a MD5 hash with the first characters equals to the challenge. The challenge is different each time.

To reduce the time of finding correct strings, a smart voter can be implemented, using a cache and storing all failed attempts. With this trick, after ~14M  requests all strings will be found inside the cache, reducing the time of generation.

You can launch the exploit script into the browser console and then refresh the page to get the flag.
