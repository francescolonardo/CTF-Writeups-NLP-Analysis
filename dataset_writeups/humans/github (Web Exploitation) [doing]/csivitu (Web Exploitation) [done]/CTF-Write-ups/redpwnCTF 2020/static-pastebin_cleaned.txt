This challenge uses XSS to get the flag from the `admin bot's` cookies.

First, try a random `<h1>Hello</h1>` tag to see if you can put HTML in your pastebin.

Inspecting the `js` file of the page we can can infer 2 things:
- the content of the page is obtained from the URL, which is a base64 encoded form of the text you entered.
- the `clean` function will not allow writing of text if bracket pairs do not match.

It is rather easy to break this `clean` function, by adding an extra `>` at the starting of your XSS script. Here's the payload:
[Payload for XSS attack with an extra ">" at the beginning of the script]

Your payload has the following URL:
[URL with base64 encoded payload]

You can simply set up a `netcat listener` using `nc -l port` on your server, and pass the link to the `Admin Bot`. The admin bot is basically a headless chrome browser which has the flag in it's cookies. When it visits your site, the XSS steals the cookies from the admin bot and sends it to your server. You get a request which looks like:
[HTTP GET request with the flag in the cookie]
