Access the login form and log in with any junk username and password, then get redirected to `/flag`.
Check cookies and find the `token` with a JWT value.
Analyze the token and discover it uses the RS256 algorithm, which requires a private key and a public key.
Find the private key in `/robots.txt`.
Use the Node.js `jsonwebtoken` library to create a new JWT token signed with the private key.
Access the `/flag` route using the newly created token as a cookie to obtain the flag.
Recognize the challenge's bug: the private key was not properly hidden.
