* Visiting the webpage we see a part of a flag: CHTB{

* If we keep looking around the pages, we find in /static/js/main another part of the flag:


* This in combination with the flag on the website is not the correct flag so far.
* static/css/main.css has another potential hint at the top with: c4n_r3ve4l_ 
* so, so far we have collected 3 pieces of a flag:

* in js.main we will also find the last piece of our flag:1nsp3ction_
* the full flag ended up being :`CHTB{1nsp3ction_c4n_r3ve4l_us3full_1nf0rm4tion}`
