The first part of the challenge is a sort of vague guesswork. In the challenge description, there are two words - `page` and `upload` - which the author wants you to notice. Also, when you view the homepage source, it has a comment `<!-- get the 'page' :eyes: -->`. 

So, the first try was to pass a query `page` in the flag. So, we tried to visit `http://web.zh3r0.ml:7777/?page=flag`. Here, we get a gif.

Now, since the description had the word `upload` in it, we tried to checkout if there is a page called upload, and there was!

Here, we can assume that we have to do some sort of local file inclusion. So we created a file called `payload.php`, and tried to `ls` the directory. We saw a lot of files called `flag`, so we just decided to print all files and just search on the browser.

Here's the final payload for the PHP code:
[PHP code payload for local file inclusion to find all files and print them]

Now you can visit the route `/?page=payload` (name of the file you uploaded). This gives a page with a lot of stuff.

So, the contents of all the files are now on the browser. All you have to do is open the source code and search for the flag format.
