Title: Bypassing Client-Side Validation to Exploit Insecure Server-Side Logic
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: Client-Side Validation
Tools used: Burp Suite
Keywords: browser developer tools, HTML, JavaScript, HTTP requests, payloads, server-side logic, validation, sanitization

#overview
During a CTF competition, I encountered a web application that implemented client-side validation to restrict user input. However, I suspected that the server-side logic might be insecure and decided to bypass the client-side validation to test the server's handling of unexpected input.

#analysis
To bypass the client-side validation, I used browser developer tools to modify the HTML and JavaScript code or intercept and modify HTTP requests using a tool like Burp Suite. For example, I removed JavaScript validation functions or altered HTML input attributes to allow for unrestricted input.

With the client-side validation bypassed, I submitted unexpected input to the web application to test the server's handling of the data. As I experimented with various payloads, I discovered that the server-side logic was indeed insecure and failed to properly validate and sanitize user input.

#attack_execution
Exploiting the insecure server-side logic, I injected malicious payloads into the web application that allowed me to access sensitive information, such as the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge.

This CTF writeup emphasizes the importance of implementing robust server-side validation and sanitization in web applications, even when client-side validation is present. By bypassing the client-side validation and exploiting the insecure server-side logic, I was able to obtain the flag needed to complete the challenge.
