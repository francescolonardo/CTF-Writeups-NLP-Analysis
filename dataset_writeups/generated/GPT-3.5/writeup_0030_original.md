Title: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attack on Login Page

During a CTF competition, I encountered a web application that included a login page. Given the potential security risks associated with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, I suspected that the application might be vulnerable to XSS attacks.

To test for XSS, I entered a payload containing a script tag and an alert message, such as <script>alert('XSS');</script>, into the login form field. Upon submitting the form, the application accepted the payload and displayed the alert message, indicating that the application was vulnerable to XSS attacks.

To demonstrate the potential risks associated with XSS, I crafted a payload that would steal the user's login credentials and send them to an attacker-controlled server. This payload included a script tag containing a function to extract the user's login credentials and an AJAX request to send the data to the attacker's server.

This payload allowed me to steal the user's login credentials and demonstrate the potential risks associated with XSS attacks.

This CTF writeup highlights the importance of properly securing web applications against XSS vulnerabilities by implementing proper input validation and output encoding controls, using Content Security Policy (CSP), and validating user input. By exploiting the vulnerability, I was able to steal sensitive information from the server, demonstrate the potential risks associated with XSS attacks, and recommend proper countermeasures to prevent these types of attacks.
