So we have to perform an XSS with these attributes. So, here's the payload:\n[Payload for XSS attack using an iframe and the 'src' attribute]\n\nNote that here, the site is supposed to be `https`, otherwise there will be a Content Security Policy Bypass (CSP Bypass) error, and the request won't be sent. We can get the URL of the resulting webpage:\n[URL with base64 encoded payload]\n\nOn the server, we can create a simple Node.js backend which accepts the cookie as a query param and logs it. Here's an example of the backend code:\n[Node.js code for a simple backend to log the stolen cookie]\n\nWhen the link for the website is sent to the `admin bot`, which is basically a headless chrome browser, it visits the page and it's cookie is stolen and sent to the server at `myserver.tld`.
