    "Accessed the webpage which has an interface to a router with a ping functionality.",
    "Identified an end-point '/ping?id=' returning base64-encoded result of each ping request.",
    "Discovered that using a sufficiently large 'id' can cause an out-of-bound memory read.",
    "Enumerated the 'id' and found that the range between IDs '18446744073709551463' to '18446744073709551615' correspond to the router's RAM, hence the RAM can be dumped this way.",
    "Executed a Python script that sends GET requests with incrementing 'id', retrieves data, decodes the base64, and appends the result to a file.",
    "Performed a string search on the 'out.bin' file and found a potential flag.",
    "Guessed that the flag is 'FLAG{r0uter_p0rtals_are_ultimately_impenetrable_because_they_are_real_weird}'."
