Title: Leveraging Insecure Deserialization to Execute Arbitrary Code

During a CTF event, I stumbled upon a web application that utilized serialized data in cookies to store user session information. This caught my attention, as insecure deserialization of user-supplied data can lead to arbitrary code execution and other serious vulnerabilities.

To test for insecure deserialization, I examined the serialized data in the cookie and identified the serialization format being used. In this case, the application was using Python's pickle module. With this knowledge, I crafted a malicious serialized object that contained arbitrary code to be executed upon deserialization by the application.

For example, I created a Python class with a __reduce__() method that would execute the desired code upon deserialization:

```
import os
import pickle

class Exploit:
    def __reduce__(self):
        return (os.system, ('cat /flag.txt > /tmp/flag_output',))

malicious_pickle = pickle.dumps(Exploit())
```

I then base64-encoded the malicious serialized object and replaced the original serialized data in the cookie with my payload. After refreshing the web page, the application deserialized my malicious payload, executing the code contained within the Exploit class.

By exploiting the insecure deserialization vulnerability, I was able to execute arbitrary code on the server, which revealed the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge.

This CTF writeup underscores the importance of properly securing web applications against insecure deserialization vulnerabilities. By exploiting insecure deserialization, I was able to execute arbitrary code on the server and obtain the flag needed to complete the challenge.
