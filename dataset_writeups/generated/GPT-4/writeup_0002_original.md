Title: Bypassing Client-Side Validation via JavaScript Console

In a recent CTF challenge, I stumbled upon a web application with a form that required user input. The form asked for an invite code, and it seemed that only users with a valid invite code could access the restricted area of the website.

Upon inspecting the source code, I discovered that the form validation was being performed only on the client-side using JavaScript. This immediately caught my attention, as client-side validation can be easily bypassed.

I decided to use the browser's JavaScript console to manipulate the validation function directly. By doing so, I was able to bypass the client-side validation and submit the form without needing a valid invite code.

To my surprise, after bypassing the validation, I was granted access to the restricted area of the website. Inside, I found the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge.

This CTF writeup highlights the importance of implementing proper server-side validation alongside client-side validation. Relying solely on client-side validation can lead to security vulnerabilities, as attackers can easily manipulate and bypass the validation checks.
