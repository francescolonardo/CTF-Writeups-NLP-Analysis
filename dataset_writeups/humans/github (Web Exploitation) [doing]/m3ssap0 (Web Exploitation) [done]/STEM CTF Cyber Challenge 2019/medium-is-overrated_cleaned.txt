Challenge is similar to the previous one, but the number of revisions is huge.

So a bash script can be written to reproduce the repository locally.

The script will recreate the `index.php` file of the previous challenge and another file called `noIdeaWhatImDoing`.

Analyzing the history situation with `bzr log` and some `bzr diff`, you can discover that files were modified several times. Maybe one of these revisions will contain the flag.

After some analysis you can discover that changes on `index.php` are the ones really important. The initial script can be modified in order to discover all important differences on `index.php`.

Two differences can be identified.

The first one contains a base64 encoded password for a Bitcoin wallet.

The second one contains an hexadecimal string.

This string must be considered like the AES ECB key to decode the Bitcoin wallet password.

Using OpenSSL we will get the flag.
