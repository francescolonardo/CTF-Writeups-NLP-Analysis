After signing up on the website, we can view our invoice. The invoice URL appears to be in the format `/legacy_invoice_system/BASE64_ENCODED_STRING`.

This base64-encoded string decodes to `USERNAME-YEAR-MONTH-DAY`

Adding a `'` to the back of the username yielded an SQL error:

It appears that the input string is split into the username and signup date, and both are passed into the SQL query without sanitization.

We can use a custom SQLMap tamper script that appends the payload to the back of the signup date, and then base64-encodes the entire input string before passing it into the custom injection point at `GET /legacy_invoice_system/*`

Running `sqlmap -r invoice.req --tamper tamper.py --threads 10 -T news_article --dump`, we can dump the database which contains the flag.
