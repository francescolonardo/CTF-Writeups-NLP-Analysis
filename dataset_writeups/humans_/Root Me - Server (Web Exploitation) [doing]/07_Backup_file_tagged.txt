Title: Vim Backup File Password Retrieval
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: Improper Input Sanitization
Tools used: None
Keywords: vim, backup files

#context
This one is a bit trickier. You are given a username and password field, but the intended solution doesn’t include any improper text sanitization.

#discovery
If you are a vim god, you would know that vim backup files are stored as the original name of the file, with a tilde character at the end of the filename.

#exploitation
Knowing this, just navigate to /index.php~, and download the file. There, you will find the password.

#countermeasures
None
```
