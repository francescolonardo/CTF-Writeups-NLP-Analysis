On view the page source we find something interesting:

* on performing a GET request with :

* we get a response

* only playing around i see three endpoints

* hitting the `/fuel` endpoint we get

* hitting `/rocketLaunch` with a simple GET request 


* But since we have to launch the rocket we can assume that we need to POST something to the endpoint
* One of the first few things that come to mind is the **launch** keyword
* we know that endpoint expects a JSON body
* we first sent : 

* we get the above response, lets specify a random rocket name since we dont know the rocket name

* endpoint tell us that **triton** is available

* now we need a launch time but we don't know what format it expects so we tried to make it tell us again

* after sending time in correct format we get this

* we can get a list of pumps and their IDs from /fuel endpoint

* interesting, now it wants a token, so we looked into the page source, we did not find anything so we started looking into the JS files of the web app and we found the token

* after sending the token we get our flag!
