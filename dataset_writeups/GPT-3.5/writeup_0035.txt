Title: "The Broken Token"

During a CTF competition, I encountered a web application that had a token-based authentication system. The application required a token to be submitted with each request to access any of its functionality.

After analyzing the code and conducting some testing, I discovered that the tokens were not being properly validated on the server-side. I found that the tokens were being generated using a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG), which made it possible to predict the next token in the sequence.

To exploit this vulnerability, I wrote a script that could predict the next valid token based on the current token. I then used this script to create a new valid token, which I was able to use to access the protected resources of the application.

With this access, I was able to perform various actions, such as uploading malicious code, accessing confidential data, and modifying user accounts.

To mitigate this vulnerability, I recommended that the application implement a more secure token generation mechanism, such as using a cryptographically secure random number generator (CS-RNG). Additionally, I suggested that the application implement proper token validation on the server-side to prevent any attempts at predicting or tampering with the tokens.

This CTF writeup highlights the importance of properly securing token-based authentication systems by using secure random number generators and implementing proper validation controls. By exploiting the vulnerability, I was able to demonstrate the potential risks associated with a weak token generation mechanism and recommend proper countermeasures to prevent these types of attacks.
