Analyzing the webpage, two strange cookies can be discovered

one is incremented at each refresh, the other contains a fixed part – at the beginning and at the end – and a variable part in the middle.

If you enumerate a great amount of cookies, you can notice that the format of variable part is the following:
previous char of the flag;
actual char of the flag;
index of the actual char.

So you can write a script to retrieve all chars and compose the flag.
