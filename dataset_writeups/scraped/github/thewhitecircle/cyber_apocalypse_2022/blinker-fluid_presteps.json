    "The challenge involved an application where the markdown input gets converted into a PDF file available for download",
    "The first step was examining the `package.json` file found in the site source",
    "In this file two dependencies 'md-to-pdf' and 'nunjucks' were identified as potentially interesting",
    "Research led to the discovery of a CVE for `md-to-pdf` and a payload that could potentially exploit this vulnerability",
    "The original payload did not work, leading to further research and discovery of a known issue in 'nunjucks' that it was having issues with single line payload",
    "It was discovered that the payload needed to be adjusted to work with `nunjucks`, this was done by making sure line 1 and 3 of the payload were written in a specific way",
    "The payload used was one that executed a command to find the flag and redirected it to a file in the invoices directory",
    "With this payload, the flag was successfully captured"
