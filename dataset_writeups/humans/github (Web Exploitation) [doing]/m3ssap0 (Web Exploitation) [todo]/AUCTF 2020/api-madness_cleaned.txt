Connecting to the webpage you will get a message that says 'for API visit help page'.

The help page will give you the following information.

[HTML code for a webpage containing information about an FTP server API, including a list of endpoints and their corresponding HTTP methods, as well as the required parameters for each endpoint.]

Using the `/api/login` endpoint an error page will appear.

The error will leak the 'login_check' endpoint. Trying to use it, you will get a "null token".

This "token" can be used to authenticate on other endpoints to discover and retrieve the flag file.

The data is base64 encoded; decoding it you will find the flag.
