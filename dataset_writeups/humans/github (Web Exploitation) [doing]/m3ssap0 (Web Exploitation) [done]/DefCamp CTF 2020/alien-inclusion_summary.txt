Examine the PHP source code provided by the challenge.

Notice that the code checks for the presence of the `start` parameter in a POST request and includes the corresponding file while echoing the `$secret` variable.

Craft an HTTP POST request with specific headers and body content that includes the `start` parameter with a value of `/var/www/html/flag.php`.

Observe the server's response with an HTTP 200 OK status code, which contains the flag in the text/html response.
