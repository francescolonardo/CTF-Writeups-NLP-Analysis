The owner of the blog is a fan of Canonical and its products. As you can see in the blog, he is fan of Bazaar, the version control system of Canonical.

Trying to connect to `.bzr/` will give an `HTTP 403 Forbidden` error, so the folder should exist.

Connecting to `README` will reveal the existence of a Bazaar repository folder.

Furthermore, connecting to `last-revision`, will reveal the last revision.

So Bazaar must be installed and a `bzr` repostitory must be created in order to craft the `.bzr` directory and then recreate the website files.

The `last-revision` can be downloaded to replace the existing one.

The `dirstate` file can be downloaded to replace the existing one.

The `pack-names` file can be downloaded replacing the existing one.

Using `bzr check` command will trigger an error that will reveal the name of the missing files.

All missing files can be downloaded.

Then the status of the repo could be checked.

The command `bzr revert` will recreate the file.

It will contain the flag.
