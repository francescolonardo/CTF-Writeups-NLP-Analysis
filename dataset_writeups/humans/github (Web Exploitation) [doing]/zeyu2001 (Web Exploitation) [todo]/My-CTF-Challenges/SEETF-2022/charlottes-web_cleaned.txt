1. Prototype pollution in `utils.merge()`

2. Off-by-one error in `background.js` font validation allows us to pollute `utils.FONTS[10]`, bypassing the validation.

3. In `setFont.js`, the `credentials: include` option can be polluted in the `fetch()` call to use the credentials for `http://app/`.

4. The output is placed in the exploit page's `style` element, and can be read by the attacker.
