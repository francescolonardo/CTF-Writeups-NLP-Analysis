The name of the challenge seems to be related to SQL injection.

The webpage contains an authentication form. The HTML source contains an interesting comment.

Connecting to `/?sauce` endpoint you can read the source code.

Authenticating with username `flagman69` should print the flag. The query is concatenating strings, so the website is vulnerable to SQL injection.

An additional control is present at the beginning on password value passed: a `strpos` function is used to check if the password contains the char `1`.

Trying to bypass the password check with a SQL injection will not print the flag after a correct login, maybe the user is not present.

Using the `UNION` clause you can discover that the `users` table has 3 columns and the second returned is the one with `username`. So the final UNION SQL injection can be crafted passing directly the value to bypass the last check: `flagman69` username.

So we get the flag.
