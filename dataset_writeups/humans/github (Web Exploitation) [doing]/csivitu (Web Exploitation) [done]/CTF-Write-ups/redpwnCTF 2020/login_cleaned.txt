This is a beginner SQL Injection challenge. To retrieve the flag, you need to inject a malicious SQL query into the login form.

Simply pass the username and the password as ' or 1=1 -- , which will be interpreted as a SQL query that always returns true, and comment out the rest of the query with the -- symbol. This will cause the server to execute the SQL query as if you had provided valid login credentials, resulting in an alert box displaying the flag.
