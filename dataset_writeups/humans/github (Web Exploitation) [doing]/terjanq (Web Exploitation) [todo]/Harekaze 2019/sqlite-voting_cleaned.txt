We can see that we've got a heavily filtered error-based blind sql injection.
First we got the length of the flag by enumerating through `$LENGTH$` in the following payload:

I will explain the payload bit-by-bit later, but the flag was 38 characters long.

Then, we double hexed the `flag` so we can be sure that it only produces digits

We also know that the length of the produced number is exactly 152-digit long.

You cannot pass integers bigger than `9223372036854775807` because they will get cast into floating numbers, but you can concatenate them as they were strings, e.g. `9223372036854775807||9223372036854775807` will produce `92233720368547758079223372036854775807`. Thanks to this property we now can iterate over all composited 152-digit long `$NUMBER$` and use the `max(A, B)` function which will return the bigger one.

We get the double hexed flag which is: 
`343836313732363536423631374136353433353434363742333433313644354633373330354636323333354633343546333537313643333133373333354636443334333533373333373237430`
