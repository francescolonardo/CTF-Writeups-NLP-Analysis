With this web application you can submit a text content to a remote S3 bucket defining a GUID for the key and then retrieving the same text content via the GUID.

The functionality endpoint is `/files/`. The GUID can be set with `X-guid` HTTP header.

Analyzing the two given python files you can discover that no intended vulnerabilities are present.

Analyzing responses, you can discover some interesting HTTP headers: Server, Via, X-Server-By.

It seems that the architecture is composed by a proxy and different hosts behind it which run the application.

Considering the infrastructure, this seems to be an HTTP Desync Attack scenario.

The malicious HTTP request will be the following (the char between `Transfer-Encoding:` and `chunked` is `0x0b`).

[HTTP POST request with a payload consisting of two parts separated by a "chunked" encoding. The request is sent to the server and includes a "x-guid" header with a specific value.]

Which will give the following answer.

[HTTP response headers indicating that a resource was created successfully with a status code of 201.]

At this point it is sufficient to read the defined object which will return a POST request containing the flag.
