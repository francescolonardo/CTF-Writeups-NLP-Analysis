When you google the challenge description, you find out that the quote is from Mr. Robot. This indicates that the user might want to check out the `robots.txt` for the website.

When you open the website, it serves the `index.html` file, which has content written about `Brobot`, again trying to put across `robots.txt`.

When you visit `robots.txt` and visit the disallowed route, you get the flag!
