The challenge is very simple once you know what to do.
This is the hint:
"We will only give our flag to our Agent 95! He is still running an old version of Windows..."

We assume Agent 95 uses Windows 95. So just change the `User-Agent` header to `Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 4.01; Windows 95)`.

We use a Python script:
[Python code: using `requests` to send a GET with the `User-Agent` header]

In the response, you got the flag.
