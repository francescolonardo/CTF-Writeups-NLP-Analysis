    "Analyzed the webpage and discovered two strange cookies: 'frequency' and 'transmissions'",
    "Noticed 'frequency' increments with each page refresh",
    "Identified that 'transmissions' had a fixed part at the beginning and end, and variable part in the middle",
    "Understood that the variable part contained the previous char of the flag, the actual char of the flag, and the index of the actual char",
    "Wrote a Python script to retrieve all characters and compose the flag",
    "Implemented a loop in the Python script to iteratively read the transmissions",
    "Implemented a condition in the Python script to retrieve cookies from the target page",
    "Unquoted and cleaned up the cookie values within the Python script",
    "Appended unique transmission values to a list",
    "Created another loop in the Python script to compose the flag",
    "Iteratively added a character to the flag if its index matched with the desired one",
    "The script printed out the flag after successful execution"
