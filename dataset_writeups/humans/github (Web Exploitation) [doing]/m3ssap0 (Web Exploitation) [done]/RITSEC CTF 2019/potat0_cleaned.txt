Connecting to the web site, an interesting HTML comment can be discovered: 'upload and photos not yet linked'.

So you can discover the existence of two more pages.

Basically the web application allows the upload of an image that will be displayed into a gallery. The upload functionality is vulnerable because it doesn't check the content of the image and it doesn't convert it in order to remove unwanted content.

As a consequence, a shell.php.jpeg can be inserted into the image.

The image is renamed, but it can be referenced to execute commands remotely and get the flag.
