    "Given a login page that does not contain any JavaScript code",
    "Found that a status 500 is received when an apostrophe is used in either the username or password field",
    "Further observed that an error does not occur if an apostrophe is used in both fields",
    "Tested an approach where the username field contained blank input enclosed in two apostrophes, and the password field contained a single apostrophe",
    "Noticed an error in the above case, indicating the presence of an unclosed apostrophe",
    "Used the same approach as above, but filled both the username and password fields with blank input enclosed by two apostrophes, and found that there was no error",
    "Confirmed the presence of blind SQL injection by using a payload of ' or sleep(2) and 1=1#",
    "Deducing it was MySQL due to the difference in syntax for other database systems",
    "Bruteforced the flag one character at a time using the SUBSTRING and SLEEP functions",
    "Explained the function syntax. SUBSTRING requires three arguments: the string to check, the position to check, and the length to check. Used the IF function which also needs three arguments: the condition, the action if true, and the action if false",
    "Automated the process using a Python script that sends a post request with the payload for every possible character in the flag. Whenever a correct character is found (indicated by a read timeout due to the 5 seconds delay), the character is appended to the flag and the script moves to the next character"
