It is now trivial to generate an MD5 collision of two images / PDF files.

Take any two PDFs of different contents, we can make them have the same MD5 hash.

BTW, there is a size limit so choose small PDFs.

These are the PDFs I generated. Note that they have different content, yet the same MD5.

After we've generated the two colliding PDFs, uploading them to the challenge page unlocks the flag and source code.
