Description: "Can you find the flag on this website."

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.
 
After start of the instance picoCTF will provide you a link to running instance.

If you type `user` as the username and `user` as the password, you will get a message that reveals the query for the login request. Since we know the query, we can easily get in by entering `'or 1=1;--` in the `pass` field. This modifies the query to be something like:
[SQL query modified with 'or 1=1;--' for bypassing authentication]

We can test some queries to find out what database is used. By entering this query: `123' UNION SELECT 1, sqlite_version(), 3;--`, we now know that the site is using SQLite.

Now we can list all tables with this query: `123' UNION SELECT name, sql, null from sqlite_master;--`. We find the flag in the table named `more_table`.

To get the flag, we use this query:
[SQL query to retrieve flag from the 'more_table']
