The challenge is very simple once you know what to do. 

We will only give our flag to our Agent 95! He is still running an old version of Windows...

We assume Agent 95 uses Windows 95. So just change the User-Agent header to Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 4.01; Windows 95).
```python



import requests
      r = requests.get('http://jh2i.com:50000', headers={'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 4.01; Windows 95)'})
      r.text
      'flag{useragentsundercover}\n\n\n NOT CHALLENGE RELATED:THANK YOU to Digital Ocean for supporting NahamCon and NahamCon CTF!\n\n\n\n'
      ```



There, you got the flag.

flag{user_agents_undercover}
