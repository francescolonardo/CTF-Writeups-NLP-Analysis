    "Identify that the first obstacle is HTTP request smuggling between ATS and Puma",
    "Recognize that ATS interprets \\\"chunked\\\" as chunked and Puma ignores invalid / unsupported Transfer-Encoding (TE) values",
    "Craft a request to smuggle a request to /admin in flagportal to perform an Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
    "Host own server to capture the request, including the Admin-Key",
    "Decode the field First-Flag to extract the first flag",
    "Understand that the above request smuggling method won't allow capturing the second response from Puma",
    "Find out that the second obstacle is HTTP request smuggling between ATS and Waitress",
    "Understand that ATS processes LF as line endings (instead of CRLF), while Waitress allows LF in chunked extensions",
    "Craft a request with LF in chunk extension",
    "Note how ATS processes the LF as the end-of-line, leading to the second request be encapsulated in the chunked content of the first request",
    "Waitress sees both received requests",
    "Run 'python3 payload.py | nc localhost 8000' to capture the request",
    "From receiving server, decode the field flag to extract the second flag",
    "Understand that both Request smuggling vulnerabilities were discovered during previous research on ATS, Puma and Waitress by the challenge provider and other researchers"
