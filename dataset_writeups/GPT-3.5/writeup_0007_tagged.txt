Title: Remote Code Execution (RCE) Attack via File Upload
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: Remote Code Execution
Tools used: None
Keywords: file upload, PHP code, web shell, server access, payload, command execution, flag

#overview
The author encountered a web application during a CTF competition that allowed users to upload and manage files. Suspecting the presence of an RCE vulnerability, the author crafted a malicious file containing PHP code and uploaded it to the application. Upon executing the code and obtaining remote access to the server, the author confirmed the vulnerability.

#analysis
The author researched the server's configuration and available commands to craft a suitable payload containing the desired command. Upon uploading the payload to the application, the command was executed, and the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge was obtained.

#attack_execution
The author exploited the RCE vulnerability by uploading a malicious file containing PHP code, which allowed for remote access to the server. The author then crafted a payload containing the desired command and uploaded it to the application, which executed the command and displayed the flag.

[CODE_REMOVED]

This CTF writeup highlights the importance of properly securing web applications against RCE vulnerabilities by validating and sanitizing user input, using file type validation and content inspection, and restricting file permissions and execution.
