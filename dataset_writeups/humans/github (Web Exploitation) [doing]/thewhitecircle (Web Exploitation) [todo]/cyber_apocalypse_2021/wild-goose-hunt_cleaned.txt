* We have a cool login page and source of the web app for this one
* entrypoint.sh contains the following :


* we can see that the flag is being stored as the password of admin
* we need to somehow extract the password
* since its mongoDB first assumption was to check for NoSQL injection
* Here is the error message we get in burp for a normal attempt

* Lets switch to repeater here

* so we are getting a json response and the message is being displayed in the frontend
* next i tried some basic payloads for NoSQL injection

* Authentication bypassed! but we dont get any functionality in the frontend so i proceeded with more payloads

* This is an interesting payload because we can use a wildcard to check if a particular character is present in the password or not! 
* we know that the flag is the password and flag begins with `CHTB{` so I tried that next

* And it works again!
* Now we can bruteforce characters and check for success message to get correct characters
* I created a small python script for it
