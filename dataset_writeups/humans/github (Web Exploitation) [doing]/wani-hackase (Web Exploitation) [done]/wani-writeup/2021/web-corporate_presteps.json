    "The first step in solving this challenge was to analyse the verify() function.",
    "The verify() function includes three checks: verifyUsername(), verifyPassword(), and verifyMFA().",
    "The first function, verifyUsername(), was just a simple string comparison, indicating that the correct username was 'D0loresH4ze'.",
    "In the second function, verifyPassword(), the code showed that a bcrypt password verification is used.",
    "The bcrypt hash was known from the PHP manual and revealed that the password was 'rasmuslerdorf'.",
    "verifyMFA() function appeared to check a 10 digit random number.",
    "Since the variable 'mfa' was created by unserializing user requests, it was possible to make 'mfa' and '_correctValue' match by using object injection.",
    "After object injection, the expected solution was constructed as 'O:8:\"stdClass\":4:{s:8:\"username\";s:11:\"D0loresH4ze\";s:8:\"password\";s:13:\"rasmuslerdorf\";s:13:\"_correctValue\";N;s:3:\"mfa\";R:4;}'.",
    "The userdata parameter was created by base64 encoding of this solution string.",
    "On the mfa service, this userdata was included as a request parameter.",
    "Finally, it allowed receiving the flag, which is the proof of successful authentication."
