Title: Uncovering Hidden Directory to Access Confidential Files

During a CTF competition, I came across a web application that seemed to have limited functionality and content. Given the simplicity of the interface, I suspected that there might be hidden directories or resources on the server, potentially containing sensitive data or flags for the Web Exploitation challenge.

To discover hidden directories, I used a directory brute-forcing tool like DirBuster, which attempts to find directories and files on a web server by making requests to a list of common or custom directory and file names. By running DirBuster against the target web application, I hoped to uncover any concealed resources.

After running the tool for a while, I discovered a hidden directory that was not directly accessible from the web application's interface. Navigating to this directory, I found a file containing sensitive information, including the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge.

This CTF writeup emphasizes the importance of properly securing web servers and applications by hiding or restricting access to sensitive directories and files. By using a directory brute-forcing tool, I was able to uncover a hidden directory, access a confidential file, and obtain the flag needed to complete the challenge.
