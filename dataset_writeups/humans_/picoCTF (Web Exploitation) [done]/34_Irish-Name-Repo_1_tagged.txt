#context
When we open the site, we see the content of the main page is not very helpful. When we look at the Support page however, we see an inquiry saying: "Hi. I tried adding my favorite Irish person, Conan O'Brien. But I keep getting something called a SQL Error." This tells us that the site uses a SQL database.

#exploitation
When we go to the Admin Login, we can try a basic SQL Injection to bypass the portal. Our injection is specifically having the username as ' OR 1=1-- and the password as whatever. What is happening here is the query checks if the username is equal to nothing. Then, it checks OR 1=1. Since 1 is always going to be equal to 1, this returns true. The -- at the end simply comments out the rest of the query. This fools the server into letting us through the portal.

#code
' OR 1=1--
