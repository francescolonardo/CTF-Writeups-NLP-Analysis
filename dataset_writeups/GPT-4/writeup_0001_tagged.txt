Title: Cookie Manipulation for Privilege Escalation
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: Server-side validation, User Input
Tools used: Browser Developer Tools
Keywords: Cookie, Privilege Escalation, User Role

#analysis
The writeup describes a CTF challenge that involved a web application allowing users to log in and view their account information. The author noticed a cookie named user_role with a value of user, which they suspected might be related to user privileges. They manipulated the cookie value to admin and were granted admin access, allowing them to view sensitive information that was restricted to regular users. This demonstrates the importance of server-side validation for cookies and user input.

#attack_execution
The author used browser developer tools to modify the user_role cookie value to admin, which granted them admin access to the web application. By exploiting the lack of server-side validation, they were able to escalate their privileges and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.

#overview
The writeup discusses the importance of server-side validation for cookies and user input in web applications. It highlights how a simple cookie manipulation technique can lead to privilege escalation and unauthorized access to sensitive information. The use of browser developer tools to modify the cookie value is a common attack vector in web exploitation.
