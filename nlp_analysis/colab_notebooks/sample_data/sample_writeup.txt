Title: Web Exploitation CTF Writeup: CookieMonster

Introduction:
In this writeup, we will discuss the solution for a Web Exploitation challenge in a Capture The Flag (CTF) competition. The challenge, named "CookieMonster," involves exploiting a web application's cookie handling and bypassing authentication to access the flag.

Challenge Description:
The challenge provides a link to a web application, which presents a login form with a username and a password field. We are also given a hint: "The CookieMonster loves cookies. Can you feed it the right one?"

Tools Used:

    Web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
    Developer Tools (built into most web browsers)
    Burp Suite (optional, for intercepting and modifying HTTP requests)

Walkthrough:

Step 1: Analyzing the web application
Upon visiting the web application, we are presented with a simple login form. To proceed, we need to explore the source code and see if there are any hidden inputs or comments that might give us more information.

Step 2: Investigating cookies
As the hint suggests, we should focus on cookies. By opening the browser's Developer Tools, we can inspect the cookies being sent and received by the web application.

We find that there's a cookie named "auth" with the value "0" being sent in the HTTP request. We can guess that the "auth" cookie is likely used to determine if the user is authenticated or not. Since its value is "0," we can assume that it represents "not authenticated."

Step 3: Modifying the cookie value
To exploit the cookie, we will change the value of the "auth" cookie to something else and observe the result. We can modify the cookie value directly in the Developer Tools, or we can use a tool like Burp Suite to intercept and modify the HTTP request.

We change the "auth" cookie value to "1" and refresh the page. This time, we are greeted with a message that says, "Almost there, but the CookieMonster is still hungry." This suggests that we are on the right track, but the value we used is not sufficient.

Step 4: Finding the correct cookie value
We can try to brute-force the correct cookie value by iterating through different numbers or using an educated guess. In this case, let's try "2" as the "auth" cookie value.

Upon refreshing the page with the "auth" cookie value set to "2," we are redirected to a page that displays the flag: "CTF{C00k13_M0n5t3r_H4ck5_Th3_W0r1d}"

Conclusion:
In this challenge, we successfully exploited the web application's cookie handling to bypass authentication and access the flag. By analyzing the hint and understanding the role of cookies in web applications, we were able to find the vulnerability and exploit it. This demonstrates the importance of understanding how cookies work and why secure handling of cookies is crucial for web application security.
