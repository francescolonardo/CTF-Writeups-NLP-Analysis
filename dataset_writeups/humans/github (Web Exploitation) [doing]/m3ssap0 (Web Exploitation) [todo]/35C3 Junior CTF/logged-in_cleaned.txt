The web site does not send double opt-in e-mail. A user can be registered, but the e-mail with the "magic code" needed to login will not be received.

Analyzing the response of the authentication API (i.e. `http://35.207.189.79/api/login`) a code can be found in the payload returned by the server. That code is the magic one that must be inserted in the window to complete the login.

After the login, a cookie will be set with the flag.
