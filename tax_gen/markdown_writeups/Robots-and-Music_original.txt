<h1>Robots and Music</h1>

<h2>The App</h2>

<p>The App consists only of a web page displaying "I hope you loke robots!. Other paths do not work and they always display the same HTML with the <code>200 OK</code> status code.</p>

<h2>Tried solutions &amp; solution</h2>

<p>Because the challenge is called "Robots and Music" and the text says "I hope you like robots!" I tried opening <code>robots.txt</code>:</p>

<p><code>
User-agent: *
Disallow: /g00d_old_mus1c.php
</code></p>

<p>Opening the page reveals the flag.</p>
