    "Analyzed the provided PHP code for the application's API request handling.",
    "Observed that 'c' parameter in requests was used to manipulate the user session, either to sign in, sign up, or sign out.",
    "Found that the user check 'is_admin()' would proceed to handle the 'c2' admin command parameter if true, otherwise would call 'redirect()'.",
    "Identified that 'redirect()' function did not actually terminate the script, but printed HTML output, allowing further code execution.",
    "Figured out the need of a passcode to perform admin functions.",
    "Discovered that '/lib/db/user.db' and '/lib/db/passcode.db' can be directly accessed from the server.",
    "Identified admin credentials and passcode from the accessed user database and passcode files.",
    "Discovered that 'export_db' function could be exploited to read file contents if the passcode was correct.",
    "Recognized that file path in 'export_db' function could be manipulated for path traversal.",
    "Performed a POST request to the /api.php endpoint with 'id', 'pw', 'c', 'c2', 'pas', and 'db' parameters, using path traversal to access the flag.",
    "Finally, found the flag 'ACSC{it_is_hard_to_name_a_flag...isn't_it?}'."
