Title: Broken Authentication in a Web Application
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: Broken Authentication
Tools used: Burp Suite
Keywords: session management, authentication controls, cookies, session tokens, password policies, login attempts

#overview
During a CTF competition, I discovered a vulnerability in a web application that allowed me to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to user accounts.

#analysis
The vulnerability was caused by a lack of proper session management and authentication controls. By intercepting and modifying HTTP requests, I was able to bypass the authentication process and gain access to user accounts without providing valid credentials.

To exploit the vulnerability, I used Burp Suite to intercept and modify HTTP requests, specifically the cookies that contained session tokens. By modifying the cookies, I was able to impersonate a valid user and gain access to their account.

This vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to steal sensitive information, manipulate data, or perform unauthorized actions on behalf of valid users.

#attack_execution
To mitigate this vulnerability, I recommended that the application implement proper session management and authentication controls, such as implementing secure session tokens, enforcing strong password policies, and limiting the number of failed login attempts.

This CTF writeup highlights the importance of properly securing web applications against broken authentication vulnerabilities by implementing proper session management and authentication controls. By exploiting the vulnerability, I was able to demonstrate the potential risks associated with a broken authentication vulnerability and recommend proper countermeasures to prevent these types of attacks.
