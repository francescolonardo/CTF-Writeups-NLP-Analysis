Assume I'm trying to create a taxonomy to categorize a set of actions taken from web application CTF writeups.
The aim is to develop a hierarchy that allows these actions to be grouped under categories and subcategories, making them easily identifiable and organized.

Please reply with a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    "Sub-category of example 1": [ "...", "...", ...],
    "Sub-category of example 2": [ "...", "...", ...],
    ...
}

Return in response just the JSON object, ensuring no additional content or remarks are added.

Example of input:
[
    "Visited the website.",
    "Accessed the webpage.",
    "Navigate to the '/example' route.",
    "Observe the form to fill.",
    "Submit the form.",
    "Find the input box.",
    "Click the submit button.",
    ...
]

Desired corresponding output example:
[
    "Page Visits and Navigations" : [
        "Visited the website.",
        "Accessed the webpage.",
        "Navigate to the '/example' route."
        ],
    "Website Interactions and Inputs" : [
        "Observe the form to fill.",
        "Submit the form.",
        "Find the input box.",
        "Click the submit button."
    ]
    ...
]

Given the actions listed below, categorized under the same macro-label, please segment them into relevant sub-categories (please try to find at least 3 sub-categories) that capture their essence and relationship:
