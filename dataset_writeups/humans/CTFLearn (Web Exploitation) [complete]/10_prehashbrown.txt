Title: Prehashbrown

The main idea finding the flag is get flag SQL Injection using Burpsuite and exploiting Database.

I have a search bar that is SQL Injection Vulnerable. So, using Burpsuite, I capture the request header and saved as header.txt.

So, I started to exploit the Database using SQLMap.

So, I tried to enumerate a certain table.
The flag is within the table and I dumped all information from the table.
Finally I get the flag!
