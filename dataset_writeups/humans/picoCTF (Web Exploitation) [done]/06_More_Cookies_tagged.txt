#context
Looking at the website, we deduce this is a continuation of the "Cookies" challenge. So let's have a look. This time the page reads: "Welcome to my cookie search page. Only the admin can use it!".

#discovery
Let's check the cookie we get from the server and we notice it's encoded. It's a base64 encoding but when I decode it, it's still in gibberish, So it's encrypted.

#context
Let's see the Hint 1: it links to a Wikipedia page for a very interesting encryption method (homomorphic encryption). It's more like an algorithm than an encryption formula.

#discovery
Reading articles about the homomorphic encryption and looking at other writeups I understand that we do not have to decrypt it to solve it, indeed this encryption allows you to perform operations on encrypted text.
Also, I noticed that the letters "CBC" are oddly capitalized in the challenge description. So, It's a CBC bitflip.

#exploitation
Meaning the encrypted text contains a bit that determines if it's admin or not. Probably something like admin=0 but I don't know its position, so I brute-forced it using a python script.
