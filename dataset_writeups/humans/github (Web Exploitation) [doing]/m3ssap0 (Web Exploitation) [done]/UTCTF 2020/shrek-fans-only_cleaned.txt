The text of the challenge reminds something about versioning control systems. Connecting to `.git/` endpoint will spawn a HTTP `403 Forbidden`. So a git local repository is present, but it can't be accessed directly.

From the main webpage you can discover another endpoint.

The value for the parameter base64 decoded will give `img1.jpg`. This endpoint is vulnerable to LFI and can be used to read files on the server.

For example you can use this to read the source code of the web pages.

A local git repository has a well known structure under `.git` folder, so you can start to read standard files to build the local repository from scratch.

In particular the `.git/logs/HEAD` file will allow you to discover the IDs of the commits and when the flag was removed from the source code.

These IDs are used to name files in the local repository. So the following objects can be identified and downloaded.

At this point you can try to restore the source code.

The next step is to check differences among the commit when the flag was removed and the first commit when the flag was present and finally get the flag.
