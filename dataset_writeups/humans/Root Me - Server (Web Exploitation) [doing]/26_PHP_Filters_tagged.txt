Title: PHP Filters for Input Validation
Primary topic: Web Exploitation

Keywords: input validation, sanitize, filters, base64 encoding

#context
PHP filters are used to validate and sanitize external input. There are a number of filters that can be applied.

#exploitation
One built-in filter is convert.base64-encode and convert.base64-decode, the former of which will be used in this exploit. It will go like php://filter/convert.base64-encode. php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource allows us to read any source of a PHP file. It forces PHP to base64 encode the file before it is used in the require statement. From there, decoding the base64 string will give us the source code for whichever PHP file is called by parameter resource. We continue guessing helpful PHP files such as config.php.

#countermeasures
It's important to use input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent attacks like this. Developers should be aware of the available filters and use them appropriately to ensure the security of their web applications.
