Analyze the given PHP script, which contains a vulnerable "SHITS" class that uses cURL for HTTP requests and has an unserialize() call on the "gg" GET parameter.
Determine that the flag is likely stored in the `config.php` file, which must be accessed via a cURL execution.
Craft a serialized object with desired parameters to exploit the unserialize method.
Set the `$method` attribute to `doit` and craft a suitable `$url` to bypass the localhost address check.
Bypass the file extension check by replacing the `.` character with `%252e` due to the `strpos` function's behavior.
Update the length of the string in the payload accordingly and URL-encode the payload.
Perform a GET request with the payload to receive the flag in the server's response.
