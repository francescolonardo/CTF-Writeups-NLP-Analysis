<p><code>
Port 11111
</code></p>

<p>This was an SQL Injection vulnerability. We had many problems for this one in terms of stability, in fact only one could attack it with sqlmap at the time.</p>

<p>We managed to get the password out from the database, which was a very long alpha-numeric string, bigger than max amount of chars accepted by the input field on the login page.</p>

<p>Passing the password with burp solved the problem and displayed a link to flag.png</p>

<h2>Afterthought</h2>

<p>We could bypass login through the username field with </p>

<p><code>
username=X'or 1=1 --
password=notThePassword
</code></p>

<p>but i missed that we could also simply bypass authentication with the password field:</p>

<p><code>
username=admin
password='or 1=1 --
</code></p>
