<ul>
<li>here we have a service which lists all the items in the mentioned dir</li>
<li>so i simply started looking for flag, look for elements in the /home dir</li>
<li>here we have a user dir and in that we have the flag.txt

</ul>

<p>now to red the file</p>

<pre><code>/home/user &amp; cat /home/user/flag.txt
</code></pre>
