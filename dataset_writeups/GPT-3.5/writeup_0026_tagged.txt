Title: File Inclusion Vulnerability Exploitation
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: File Inclusion
Tools used: None
Keywords: path traversal, arbitrary code execution, sensitive information

#overview
During a CTF competition, I encountered a web application that included a file inclusion feature allowing users to include files on the server. Given the potential security risks associated with file inclusion vulnerabilities, I suspected that the application might be vulnerable to file inclusion attacks.

#analysis
To test for file inclusion, I entered a malicious payload containing a path traversal attack into the file inclusion parameter, such as ../../../../../../etc/passwd, which would cause the application to include the '/etc/passwd' file on the server.

Upon submitting the payload, the application included the '/etc/passwd' file, confirming the presence of a file inclusion vulnerability.
