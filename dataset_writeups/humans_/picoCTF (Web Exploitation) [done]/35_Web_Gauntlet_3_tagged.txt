Title: Web Gauntlet 3
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: SQL Injection
Tools used: None
Keywords: username, password, filter.php

#context
The challenge is the exact same as Web Gauntlet 2 but we now have a 25 total character limit for our username and password field entry.

#code
```
username: ad'||'min
password: a' IS NOT 'b
```

#exploitation
After inputting these values for username and password we login and get the message "Congrats! You won! Check out filter.php".

#context
Reloading the filter.php file we get the source code for the challenge along with the flag in the comments just as for Web Gauntlet 2.
