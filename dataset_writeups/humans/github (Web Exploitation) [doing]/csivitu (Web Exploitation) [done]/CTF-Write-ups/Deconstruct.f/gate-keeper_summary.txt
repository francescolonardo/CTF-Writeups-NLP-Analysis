Import necessary libraries and initialize variables.
Set URL, check string, key, and column values for the chosen challenge ("Taxi Union" or "Gate Keeper").
Iterate through each character in the domain while searching for the flag.
Create an SQL injection payload for each character, checking if it's a prefix of the targeted column's value.
Send an HTTP POST request with the payload as form data.
If the check string is found in the response, add the character to the flag and continue iterating.
Repeat the process until the entire flag is discovered using the Python script's SQL injection exploit.
