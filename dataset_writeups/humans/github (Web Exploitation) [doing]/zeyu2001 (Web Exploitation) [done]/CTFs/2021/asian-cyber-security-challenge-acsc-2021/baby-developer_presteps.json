    "Identified a 'genflag' server intended for Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF).",
    "Recognized that 'mobile-viewer' couldn't directly interact with server due to remote address and user agent checks.",
    "Noticed server-rendered pages as screenshots.",
    "Realized needed to request 'http://genflag/flag' from 'website' using '/home/stypr/readflag' on that same 'website'.",
    "Discovered that 'website' runs 'yarn dev', which in turn runs 'vitepress dev src', and that Vitepress is in dev mode.",
    "Found that Vitepress running in dev mode enabled CORS and opened up path traversal vulnerabilities.",
    "Used the path traversal to get the SSH key from 'http://website/../../../../../home/stypr/.ssh/id_rsa'.",
    "Created a CSRF request using Fetch API on 'mobile-viewer' page to get SSH key to our attacker site.",
    "Used btoa javascript function to base64 encode the private key for safe transmission in an HTTP GET request to the attacker's server.",
    "Retrieved the received private key and used it to SSH onto the target server.",
    "Obtained the flag from within the target server."
