# Cookie Monster
Once again, we've got a simple webpage with URL reporting functionality. After a quick inspection we see two endpoints `/getflag` and `/cookies`. 
When visiting `/cookies` our `cookies` are being displayed and it looks like `user_DE7aL1xDCe3BauCWqSVqg_0C5bu2078UgQHIqYsF2h0= 311`. 
That's a valid variable in JavaScript so by including this script on the prepared website 

and then reading the window variable
we get the admin's cookie `admin_GgxUa7MQ7UVo5JHFGLbqzuQfFFy4EDQNwZWAWJXS5_o=` and then the flag.
