Title: Local File Inclusion Exploit to Access Sensitive Files
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: Local File Inclusion
Tools used: None
Keywords: LFI, sensitive files, server, exploit, flag, validation, sanitization

#overview
During a CTF competition, I discovered a web application vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI) due to a URL parameter structure that allowed users to view different pages. I exploited the vulnerability to access sensitive files on the server and obtain the flag needed to complete the Web Exploitation challenge.

#analysis
To test for the LFI vulnerability, I modified the file parameter in the URL and attempted to include a local file from the server. By submitting the modified URL, I was able to access the contents of the /etc/passwd file, confirming the presence of the LFI vulnerability. I then tried to access other sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files or log files that might contain valuable information.

#attack_execution
After exploring various files, I found a sensitive file that contained the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge. By exploiting the LFI vulnerability, I was able to access sensitive files on the server and obtain the flag needed to complete the challenge.

This CTF writeup highlights the importance of properly validating and sanitizing user input in web applications to prevent LFI vulnerabilities.
