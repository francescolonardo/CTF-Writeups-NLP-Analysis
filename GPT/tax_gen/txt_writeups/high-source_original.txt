Challenge

This guy is getting wayyy too full of himself. He's called himself a master programmer, and he believes he has written a secure login function. Knock him off his high source.

Solution
The login is performed via a JavaScript script (i.e. scripts/login.js).
Analyzing the code you can see the password that should be used to login:

I4m4M4st3rC0d3rH4x0rsB3w43

Using that password, you can find the flag:

TUCTF{H1gh_S0urc3_3qu4ls_L0ng_F4ll}
