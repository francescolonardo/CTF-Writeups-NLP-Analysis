On our user profile, we can find a list of books that we have created on the Minecraft server.

Each book is hosted as a file on `files.minecraft.tasks.yauzactf.com`. For instance, my books were at `/books/VARAVUG66ZZWXG2IFAJ0/FILENAME`, where `FILENAME` is the name of the book in Minecraft.

Going to `/books/VARAVUG66ZZWXG2IFAJ0/` gave the header `X-Powered-By: PHP/7.3.28`, revealing that this was a PHP server.

Files with "regular" extensions are served as `Content-Type: application/octet-stream` and downloaded. However, using an extension like `.html` will cause the page to be rendered inline.

Knowing that a PHP server is used, we could perhaps upload a `.php` file to run arbitrary PHP code. With a payload like the following, we could obtain a webshell.

The `.php` extension, however, was filtered recursively. I started testing other similar file extensions and eventually found that the `.phtml` extension (which also allows execution of PHP code) was not filtered and behaved as expected.

Subsequently, navigating to our uploaded webshell and specifying the `cat /flag.txt` command:

The flag is
