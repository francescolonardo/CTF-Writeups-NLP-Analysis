    "Looked at the code and the `cookie.php` file was included in every page",
    "Noticed in the `cookie.php` file there is a code segment that will deserialize our cookie and print the object when an error occurs",
    "Realized we are in the context of a deserialization vulnerability",
    "Stored any object in the cookie to be unserialized",
    "Exploited the `__construct` function present in the `access_log` class in `authentication.php`",
    "Realized the `__toString()` method is called when the object is converted to a string, so we can get the `$perm` variable to be our custom `access_log` object",
    "Serialized our custom `access_log` object, where we set `log_file` to `../flag`",
    "Encoded the serialized object to base64 and url encoded it using CyberChef",
    "Added it as the `login` cookie on our browser and went to `authentication.php`",
    "The custom `access_log('../flag')` object was deserialized which invoked the `__toString()` method resulting in arbitrary file read on the target system"
