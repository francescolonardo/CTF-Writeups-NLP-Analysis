#context
When we visit the site, it says: "Only people who use the official PicoBrowser are allowed on this site!""

#discovery
There are many ways to approach this, I ended up using Postman's HTTP request, but some alternatives are cURL and Burp Suite.

#exploitation
We'll unhide requests and override the default User-Agent request with a PicoBrowser agent. Now the site says: "I don't trust users visiting from another site.".
So, we need to make the HTTP header show it's from the same site. We'll use Referer header. Now, it says: "Sorry, this site only worked in 2018.".
We'll use the Date header with any value from 2018. Now, it says: "I don't trust users who can be tracked.".
We can set the DNT header which means "do not track" to 1 (true). Now, it says: "This website is only for people from Sweden.".
We can use the X-Forwarded-For header which will change the originating IP address. Grab any random IP address from Sweden. Now, it says: "You're in Sweden but you don't speak Swedish?".
We can use the Accept-Language header to specify which languages are ok. We can look through a list of languages and find Sweden's subtag is `sv`.
At the end, we get the flag.
