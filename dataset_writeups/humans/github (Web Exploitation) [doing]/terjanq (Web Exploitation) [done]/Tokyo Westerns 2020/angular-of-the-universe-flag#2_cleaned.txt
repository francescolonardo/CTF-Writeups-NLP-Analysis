As mentioned, the application was displaying the flag if the request came from the loopback network.

Because the application was hidden behind Nginx proxy, `req.ip` was always pointing to the same IP address of the reverse proxy. The application didn't also trust `X-Forwarded-*` headers so this value couldn't be overridden. 

When accessing `/q` endpoint, the application was displaying contents of `/api/answer`. It was done on the server-side via the below snippet.

`this.service.getAnswer()` was yielding `this.http.get('/api/answer')`.

Apparently angular when doing HTTP requests uses `Host` header, something around `PROTOCOL + HOST + / PATH`. Not only that but also follows the redirects. Therefore by providing a custom host and redirecting anything to `127.0.0.1/api/true-answer`, we get the flag.
