Title: Directory Traversal Attack on File Upload Functionality
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: Directory Traversal
Tools used: None
Keywords: file upload, payload, path traversal

#context
During a CTF competition, I encountered a web application that allowed users to upload files to the server. Given the potential security risks associated with file uploads, I suspected that the application might be vulnerable to Directory Traversal, a type of vulnerability that allows attackers to access files outside of the intended upload directory.

#discovery
To test for Directory Traversal, I crafted a malicious payload containing a path traversal sequence, such as ../, and appended it to the filename of a file that I wanted to upload, such as ../../../etc/passwd.

#exploitation
If the application allowed the payload to execute and upload the file to the server outside of the intended upload directory, it would confirm the presence of a Directory Traversal vulnerability. Upon submitting the crafted payload to the application, it indeed executed and uploaded the file to the server outside of the intended upload directory, confirming the vulnerability.

#discovery
To obtain the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge, I needed to use the Directory Traversal vulnerability to access a specific file on the server. After researching the server's file structure, I crafted a suitable payload containing the path to the desired file, such as ../../../flag.txt, and submitted it to the application's file upload functionality.

#exploitation
The server successfully recognized the payload and responded with the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge.

#countermeasures
This CTF writeup highlights the importance of properly securing web applications against Directory Traversal vulnerabilities by implementing proper file upload controls, using secure file paths, and validating user input. By exploiting the vulnerability, I was able to access sensitive files, execute malicious code, and complete the Web Exploitation challenge.
