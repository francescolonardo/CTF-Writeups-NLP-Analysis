The website allows to use cowsay command to print messages.

There is a functionality to create your own cowfile.

Considering that you can write your own, probably that one is represented following this format and the string you pass to the cow designer functionality is appended after `$the_cow` variable.

You can try to modify the content of that file with a code like the following.

[Perl code that lists the files in the current directory and prints their names.]

The `A` letter is a placeholder that with a proxy must be changed to ``\n (`0x0a`). Furthermore, due to a restriction in the functionality, you can only use variables already defined into the Perl script, like `$eyes`.

You can use an HTTP request to enumerate the directory content.

And another HTTP request to print the flag file.
