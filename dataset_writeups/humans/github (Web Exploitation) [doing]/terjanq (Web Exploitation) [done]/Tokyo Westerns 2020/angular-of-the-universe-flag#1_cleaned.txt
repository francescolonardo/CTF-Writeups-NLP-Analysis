The goal was to access `/debug/answer` endpoint which was restricted in two ways:
* the nginx restricted access to `/debug*` via:

* the application was rejecting requests containg a `debug` word via:

I managed to score the first blood on this challenge via a simple request to `/\%64ebug/answer`. 

This works because angular recognizes `\` as `/`, and %-decodes strings. Therefore it matched to `debug/answer`. 

When playing with the challenge, I also found a super fancy way of solving the challenge for the second flag. 

When Angular tries to match up the path, it parses the URL created from `PROTOCOL + HOST + PATH`. Because we injected `\debug\answer` as the host, the Angular parses `http://\debug\answer\` and retrieves the `path` as `/debug/answer`. This is an ultimately odd behavior! 

The code responsible for this odd behavior can be found [here](https://github.com/angular/universal/blob/v10.1.0/modules/express-engine/src/main.ts#L56-L57).
