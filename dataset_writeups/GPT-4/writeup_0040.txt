Title: Server-Side Template Injection Exploitation to Gain Remote Code Execution

During a CTF competition, I encountered a web application that allowed users to create custom templates using a templating engine. This functionality caught my attention, as it might be vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI), which could potentially allow me to execute arbitrary code on the server.

To test for an SSTI vulnerability, I provided a template input that contained a simple expression, such as {{ 7 * 7 }}, and observed the output. If the web application returned the evaluated result of the expression (e.g., 49), it would confirm the presence of an SSTI vulnerability.

To exploit the SSTI vulnerability and obtain the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge, I crafted a template input that contained code to read the content of the flag file. For example, the following input could be used in the case of a Jinja2 templating engine:

```
{{ ''.__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[40]('/path/to/flag.txt').read() }}
```

After submitting the crafted input, the web application executed the code and displayed the content of the flag file, allowing me to obtain the flag needed to complete the challenge.

This CTF writeup emphasizes the importance of securely handling and processing user input in web applications that utilize server-side templating engines to prevent SSTI vulnerabilities. By exploiting the SSTI vulnerability, I was able to execute arbitrary code on the server and obtain the flag needed to complete the challenge.
