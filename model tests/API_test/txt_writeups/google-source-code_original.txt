Brief Description
Requirements

PHP Local File Inclusion (LFI)

Source

http://web.zh3r0.ml:7777/
The description on the website mentions page and upload.

Exploitation
The first part of the challenge is a sort of vague guesswork. In the challenge description, there are two words - page and upload - which the author wants you to notice. Also, when you view the homepage source, it has a comment <!-- get the 'page' :eyes: -->. 


So, the first try was to pass a query page in the flag. So, we tried to visit http://web.zh3r0.ml:7777/?page=flag. Here, we get a gif.

Now, since the description had the word upload in it, we tried to checkout if there is a page called upload, and there was!


Here, we can assume that we have to do some sort of local file inclusion. So we created a file called payload.php, and tried to ls the directory. We saw a lot of files called flag, so we just decided to print all files and just search on the browser. Here's the final payload:
php
<?php
system('find . -type f -exec cat {} +');
?>

Now you can visit the route /?page=payload (name of the file you uploaded). This gives a page with a lot of stuff.


So, the contents of all the files are now on the browser. All you have to do is open the source code and search for the flag format.


The flag is:

zh3r0{h3y_d1d_y0u_upl04d_php_c0rr3ct1y???_84651320}
