Title: "Blind SQL Injection in User Authentication"

During a CTF competition, I discovered a blind SQL injection vulnerability in a user authentication feature of a web application. The application allowed users to login with their username and password, which were checked against a database using SQL queries. However, the application did not properly sanitize the user input, allowing me to craft a malicious SQL query that returned true or false values depending on the input.

To exploit the vulnerability, I crafted a malicious SQL query that checked if a user with a specific username and password existed in the database. The application did not return any error messages or visible results, but I was able to determine if the query was successful by the time it took for the application to respond.

Using this blind SQL injection technique, I was able to bypass the user authentication and gain access to the system. With access to the system, I was able to perform various actions, such as accessing sensitive data and modifying the website content.

To mitigate this vulnerability, I recommended that the application implement proper input validation and sanitation techniques to prevent SQL injection attacks. The application should also implement proper error handling techniques to prevent blind SQL injection attacks.

This CTF writeup highlights the importance of properly securing user authentication features in web applications by implementing proper input validation and sanitation techniques to prevent SQL injection attacks. By exploiting the vulnerability, I was able to demonstrate the potential risks associated with a blind SQL injection vulnerability in a user authentication feature and recommend proper countermeasures to prevent these types of attacks.
