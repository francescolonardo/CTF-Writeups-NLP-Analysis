Secondary topic: Credential Bruteforcing
Tools used: Hydra, Firefox, CyberChef
Keywords: cookies, base64 encoding

#context
It will be foundamental later. After a ton of guessing and a little hint from the official discord page of picoCTF we found that the credentials to log in as a regular user were: username=guest and password=guest. The really intresting part in this page are the cookies, in fact there is a new cookie base64 encoded called user_info.

#discovery
Credential bruteforcing: The credentials can be found with hydra and the http[s]-{get|post}-form module. The user= and pass= are the post variables found from the debugging console in Firefox.

#exploitation
Login as guest:guest. Get cookie. URL and Base64Decode using CyberChef. Change the cookie. Encoding using CyberChef. Set cookie to new cookie. Change URL to file=admin. You got the flag.
