When you visit the website, you find that there's a cookie containing a JWT. It's hashed using `HS256`. The JWT secret was brute-forced using `rockyou.txt` and John The Ripper, which revealed the secret as `supersecret`. Using this secret, a JWT with `username: admin` was created and added to the cookie, logging in as admin.

By climbing up the Python MRO using `__class__` and `__bases__`, etc., a list of all available classes was found. At index 405, the `subprocess.Popen` class was discovered.
