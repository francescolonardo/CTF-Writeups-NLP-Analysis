<h2>Kevinâ€™s Cookies</h2>

<p>In cookies, there is a key called likeCookie whose value is false. If we change the value to true, we will see the following message.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh silly you. What do you mean you like a true cookie?
  I have 20 cookies numbered from 1 to 20, and all of them are made from super true authentic recipes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>script
```python
import requests</p>

<p>url = "http://litctf.live:31778/"</p>

<p>for i in range(20):
    r = requests.get(url, cookies={"likeCookie":str(i)})
    if "LITCTF{" in r.text:
        print("likeCookie : ", i)
        break
```</p>
