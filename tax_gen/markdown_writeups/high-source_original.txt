<h2>Challenge</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>This guy is getting wayyy too full of himself. He's called himself a master programmer, and he believes he has written a secure login function. Knock him off his high source.</p>
  
  <p><a href="http://highsource.tuctf.com/">http://highsource.tuctf.com/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>The login is performed via a JavaScript script (i.e. <code>scripts/login.js)</code>.</p>

<p>Analyzing the code you can see the password that should be used to login:</p>

<p><code>
I4m4M4st3rC0d3rH4x0rsB3w43
</code></p>

<p>Using that password, you can find the flag:</p>

<p><code>
TUCTF{H1gh_S0urc3_3qu4ls_L0ng_F4ll}
</code></p>
