    "Opened the provided URL which returned a page that accepts another URL and submits it.",
    "Observed possibility of XSS attack from bot's lens when it visits the URL provided on the page.",
    "Analyzed the source code of the page and identified JavaScript functions that handle creation of iframe or appending script source, and a message event listener that conducts some checks on iframe data from URL.",
    "Understood that the challenge is to pass checks where there should not be any dots, double slashes or non-ascii dot in the iframe value in the url.",
    "Noticed a flaw in check condition where it checks if iframe is not an object instead of checking if iframe value is not an object.",
    "Created a payload that doesn't have dots or double slashes. This is done using data URI in the form 'data:text/html;base64,<base64 data>'.",
    "The base64 data encodes an XMLHttpRequest which retrieves document's cookie and sends to a specified server.",
    "Payload is structured in JSON and added to the URL after first  '?' character.",
    "Submitted the URL so that it is visited by the bot.",
    "Received the flag in server logs as a cookie in the HTTP GET request."
