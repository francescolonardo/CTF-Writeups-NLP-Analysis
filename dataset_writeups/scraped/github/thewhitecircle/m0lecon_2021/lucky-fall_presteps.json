    "We have a simple login page",
    "JSON body is sent to the server which contains username and password",
    "Unusual thing here is that the error is shown in a javascript alert",
    "The page source looked normal so I proceeded to intercept the login request with burpsuite",
    "If we remove the 'name' key value pair from JSON body we can see the following error",
    "This error reveals few things to us: python flask backend is used, the exceptions are showed in the alert pop up, 'name' key value pair are required",
    "After this I tried to remove the 'password' key",
    "Here we can see an 'if' condition which looks like the logic behind the login function",
    "It is calculating the SHA256 hash of concatenation of 'password' and 'salt'",
    "Then it compares it with a 'hash' value",
    "But if we take a look carefully we can see that the values of 'salt' and 'hash' are being taken from the JSON request body",
    "So we can set our own 'salt' and 'hash' just like 'username' and 'password'",
    "I wrote a small python script to get the flag",
    "Here 'username', 'password' and 'salt' can be any values, we just need to satisfy the if condition to get the flag"
