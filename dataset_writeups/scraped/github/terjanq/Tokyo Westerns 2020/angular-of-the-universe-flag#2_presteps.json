    "Identified the challenge as one requiring bypass of an Angular application setup behind an Nginx reverse proxy",
    "Recognized two flags; one hidden in angular endpoint /debug/answer restricted by Nginx and application, and one hidden in express endpoint /api/true-answer accessible only from localhost (IP: 127.0.0.1)",
    "For the second flag, analyzed server-side JavaScript handling requests to '/api/true-answer', which only responded with the flag if the request came from the loopback network",
    "Noted the situation that even though the app was hidden behind Nginx reverse proxy, 'req.ip' always pointed to the same IP address of the reverse proxy",
    "Identified that the application didn't trust 'X-Forwarded-*' headers so the IP address couldn't be overridden",
    "Noticed when accessing '/q' endpoint, the application displayed contents of '/api/answer'. This was done server-side",
    "Understood 'this.service.getAnswer()' led to 'this.http.get('/api/answer')' as it's a part of Angular\u2019s internal methods showing it was fetching '/api/answer' from server-side",
    "Found out Angular, while performing HTTP requests, uses a Host header - 'PROTOCOL + HOST + / PATH' - and also follows redirects",
    "Formulated a strategy to provide a custom host and redirect anything to '127.0.0.1/api/true-answer' for capturing the flag",
    "Executed the curl command 'curl 'http://universe.chal.ctf.westerns.tokyo/a' -H 'Host: terjanq.me' to bypass restrictions",
    "Successfully obtained the flag {you-have-to-eat-tomato-yume-chan!} as a result of the bypass"
