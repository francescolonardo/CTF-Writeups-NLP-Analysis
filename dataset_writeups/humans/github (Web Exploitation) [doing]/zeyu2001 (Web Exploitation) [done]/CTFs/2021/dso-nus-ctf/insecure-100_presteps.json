    "Identified that the binary calls the 'id' command three times, with and without privileges",
    "Recognized the need to manipulate the PATH variable to execute arbitrary code when 'id' is called, due to the SUID flag being set",
    "Understood the goal to read the 'flag.txt' file that requires root access, meaning a shell needs to be spawned as root",
    "Created a bash script that would only spawn the shell if the caller is root",
    "Translated the bash script into a one-liner to create a malicious 'id' payload",
    "Went to the '/tmp' directory",
    "Created an 'id' file with the malicious payload and set its permissions to 777 to make it executable",
    "Exported '/tmp' to the PATH to ensure the shell would execute the malicious 'id'",
    "Ran 'insecure' to obtain a root shell and confirm the malicious 'id' could be run as root",
    "Read the 'flag.txt' file using the root shell, successfully getting the challenge flag"
