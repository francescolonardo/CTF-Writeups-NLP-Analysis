#overview
In this CTF challenge, the objective was to exploit a web application to gain access to an administrator account.

#analysis
The website had a login page that allowed users to enter a username and password. The source code for the login page revealed that the authentication was performed using a simple SQL query. By manipulating the input fields, it was possible to bypass the authentication and gain access to the administrator account. 

#attack_execution
The solution involved using SQL injection techniques to modify the SQL query in a way that allowed us to login as the administrator. The tool used for this challenge was SQLMap.
