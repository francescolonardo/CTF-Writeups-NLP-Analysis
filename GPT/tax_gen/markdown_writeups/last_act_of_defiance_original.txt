<h1>Last Act of Defiance</h1>

<h3>Category: Web Exploitation</h3>

<h3>Author: Greg Vance (Expergefied)</h3>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>We received a message from the founder of Flag West. They said that there was one flag that they were able to hide before Mom &amp; Pops got them all. The message said that it is hidden somewhere in the website, and that you just need to inspect it a little. Flag West was one of the first aquisitions that Mom &amp; Pops made, so it is surprising to hear that there still might be a flag left. Get in there and find that flag, make Flag West's last act of defiance worth something.</p>
