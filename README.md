## Overview  

This repository contains scripts and prompts for analyzing **Capture The Flag (CTF) writeups** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.  
The goal is to categorize **attacker behaviors, strategies, and techniques** extracted from CTF reports and create a structured **taxonomy** to classify and understand different attack methods.  

By leveraging **GPT models**, the system processes and organizes data into a structured format, making it easier to analyze recurring **tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)** used in CTF challenges.  

## Features  

- **Automatic extraction** of attacker strategies from CTF writeups  
- **NLP-based classification** of attack techniques  
- **Taxonomy generation** for systematic attack categorization  
- **GPT-assisted processing** to structure and normalize CTF reports  
- **JSON output format** for further analysis and visualization  

## Background  

This project is based on a **Master’s Thesis at Politecnico di Torino**:  

> *Tassonomia dei comportamenti degli attaccanti nelle sfide di Capture The Flag (CTF): un approccio di categorizzazione attraverso l’analisi dei writeups*  
> *Francesco Lonardo, Academic Year 2022/2023*  

The research focuses on **analyzing attacker behaviors in CTF competitions** using AI-driven NLP models. Writeups from various sources were collected and processed using GPT-based techniques, with the ultimate goal of developing a **taxonomy** to classify and understand common attack patterns.  

The methodology includes:  
- Collecting **real-world CTF writeups**  
- Using **GPT models** to process and segment writeups into structured steps  
- Creating a **hierarchical taxonomy** for attack classification  
- Comparing results with **MITRE ATT&CK, OWASP, and other security frameworks**
