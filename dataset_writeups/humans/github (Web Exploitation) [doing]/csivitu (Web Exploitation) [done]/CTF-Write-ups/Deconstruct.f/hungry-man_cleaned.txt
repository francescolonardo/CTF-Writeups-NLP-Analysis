The challenge begins with the given text: "There is nothing here I promise! ;)"

Upon opening the link, an image is displayed. By checking the network tab, a response header with a specific string is found. A curl request is then sent, setting the cookie to the given string.

The response contains another string. A new curl request is sent with this new string as the cookie.

To automate this process, a Python script is written:
[Define the initial URL and the first flag value.
Create a loop that continues until the final flag value, 'EOF', is found.
In each iteration, send an HTTP GET request to the URL with the current flag value as a cookie.
Append the received string to the list of flags and continue iterating.
Once the loop is finished, print the received strings.]

The output contains multiple strings, which appear to be MD5 hashes. After decoding these hashes, a sequence of characters is obtained, which is the flag.
