Understand that the challenge requires exploiting PHP loose comparison, specifically using `==` to compare variables of different types.
Ensure `$to_check` is `0` to exploit PHP loose comparison.
Create an 8-byte file equivalent to the data in `cipher + 0xd34db33f` and upload it.
The key will be XORed with `cipher + 0xd34db33f`, and if they are equivalent, the XOR result will be zero.
The if statement `0 == "whatever the password is"` will evaluate to true, and the flag will be echoed back.
