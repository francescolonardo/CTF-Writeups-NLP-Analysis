Title: Irish-Name-Repo 2
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: SQL Injection
Tools used: None
Keywords: blind SQLi, filter bypass

#context
This site looks a lot like the one from Irish-Name-Repo 1, yet once we try this same SQL Injection of ' OR 1=1-- here, we get nothing but a page that says SQLi detected.

#discovery
After some playing around, we can figure out that the filter detects several keywords, including UNION which was the solution for last year's SQLi filter challenge.

#exploitation
However, after some blind SQLi, we bypass the filter by setting the username to admin'-- and the password to whatever. We are guessing that the username here should be admin and then commenting out the rest so that the password is not checked.

#code
None

#countermeasures
None
