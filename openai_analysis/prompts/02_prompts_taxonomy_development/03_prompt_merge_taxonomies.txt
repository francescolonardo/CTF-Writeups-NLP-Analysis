Given these existing hierarchies related to themes in web security, re-organize and integrate them to produce an optimized three-tiered taxonomy. This revamped taxonomy will serve as a reference for labeling dataset of actions derived from CTF writeups of web applications.

Before diving into the merging process, you should:
- Re-organize and restructure the provided taxonomies as a preliminary step.
- Consider the elimination of any unnecessary, too specific, or uncommon categories present in the input taxonomies.
- Remove any redundancies to avoid repetitions and overlap between categories.

Key objectives during this integration are:
1. Minimize overlap between categories.
2. Eliminate redundancies and avoid repetitions.
3. Ensure each level in the taxonomy showcases a clear hierarchical distinction, with every subsequent level refining and specifying the category further.

The resulting taxonomy should adhere to the following structure:
- Each top-level key signifies a broad category from the first tier.
- The value associated with each of these first-tier keys should be another JSON object, symbolizing the second tier of the taxonomy.
- Each second-tier key should represent a more granular sub-category, with its value being another JSON object, indicating the third tier.
- Third-tier keys will contain empty JSON objects as their values, providing flexibility for further refinements in the future.

Your mission is to critically analyze the given hierarchies, pinpoint commonalities and discrepancies, and weave them into a unified and thorough classification system. This system should function as a definitive guide for themes rooted in the actions documented in the case studies from the specified domain.

Note: Your output should consist solely of the JSON structure, without any additional commentary, explanations, or external content.
