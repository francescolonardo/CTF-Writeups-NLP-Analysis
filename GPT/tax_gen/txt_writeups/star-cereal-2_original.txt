Description
Ha, that was sneaky! But I've patched the login so that people like you can't gain access anymore. Stop hacking us!

The flag is in the flag format: STC{...}

Solution
In index.php, notice the following comment
```markup

```
Point 1) is referring to the previous challenge. Point 2) is interesting.
If we go to login.php, we get a 403 Forbidden Page:
```markup
Forbidden
Only admins allowed to login.
```
Spoofable Client IP
We could deduce that perhaps the server filters requests by the client IP. 
A common security misconfiguration in implementing such a filter is the use of the X-Forwarded-For header. This header is used for identifying the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through an HTTP proxy or a load balancer.
Note that HTTP request headers can be easily spoofed. Knowing that one of the internal IP addresses is 172.16.2.155, we may want to check the 172.16.2.0/24 subnet for valid client IPs.
If we do a scan (e.g. using Burp Suite Intruder) for the 172.16.2.0/24 subnet with the X-Forwarded-For header, we would find that if we set:
http
X-Forwarded-For: 172.16.2.24

then we would see the login page.
Burp Suite Intruder Scan
First, set the payload position as follows:

Then, configure the payload as a list of numbers from 1 to 255.

Run the attack. Sort the output by either the Status or Length columns. We will find that X-Forwarded-For: 172.16.2.24 gives us a 200 OK response code, and shows us the login page.

SQL Injection
Once we have access to the login page, notice the login form fields.
```markup


Email address



Password


Submit

```
We need to submit an email and a pass parameter. We can exploit SQL injection to get the flag.
```http
POST /login.php HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:55043
X-Forwarded-For: 172.16.2.24
...
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 51
email=test&pass=test' UNION SELECT 'test', 'test';#
```
The flag is STC{w0w_you'r3_r3lly_a_l33t_h4x0r_bc1d4611be52117c9a8bb99bf572d6a7}.
