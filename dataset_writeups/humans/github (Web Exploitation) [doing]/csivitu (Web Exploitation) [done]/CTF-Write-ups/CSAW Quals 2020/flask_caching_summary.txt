Analyzed `flask_caching` module documentation and found the option to store python pickle in redis with '!' prefix.
Recognized that python pickles can be used for RCE when `pickle.load()` is used to load cached data.
Set up a netcat listener on the server.
Ran the provided Python script with server IP and PORT to create and send RCE payload.
Received the flag on the netcat listener through an HTTP POST request.
