The website is a WordPresss site where some links are cickable and reveal 2 blog posts where you can comment (in one of them).

`?p=1` has a blog post page where you can comment. First, I tried to create a comment aaannnd ... nothing? Interestingly, the URL is now `http://01.linux.challenges.ctf.thefewchosen.com:51490/?p=1&unapproved=2&moderation-hash=11d64a466de22952e34eaae54f57abc3#comment-2`. Seems like comments need to be approved or something.

Then I tried XSS but it does not really seem to work. The `<script>` tags seem to be removed and sometimes the commen isn't even listed.

Then I decided to look more closely at the source code of the page. I downloaded it from the "save all" menu in the browser and look at it in an IDE.

Then I found something suspicious. Some JavaScript named `mec-frontend` and some settings for some sort of calendar?
[HTML code: mec-frontend JavaScript and calendar settings with various variables and properties]

This looked suspicious, especially because the challange was called "Calendar" and had "Are online calendars trusty?" as a description.

Also, 2 other lines with a `<link>` Tag seemed weird:
[HTML code: alternate oembed links]

Mec seems o relate to a WordPress Plugin "Modern events calendar" (https://webnus.net/modern-events-calendar/). The used version has 2 entries in the explort database:
- https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50084
- https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50082

The firs one seems to need authentication so it does not work in our case. But the second one did not seem to work, too.
