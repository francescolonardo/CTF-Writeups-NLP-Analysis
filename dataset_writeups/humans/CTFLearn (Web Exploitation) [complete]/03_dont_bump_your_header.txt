Title: Don't Bump Your Head(er)

When you visit the site, you can find the clue in the HTML code:
"Sorry, it seems as if your user agent is not correct, in order to access this website."

From the clue above, we have to change the user agent to Sup3rS3cr3tAg3nt before we send the request to the site.

Using postman, change the user agent and send GET request to /header.php. You will get this response:
"Sorry, it seems as if you did not just come from the site, 'awesomesauce.com'."

You have to change the Referer in the header to awesomesauce.com then you send GET request again to /header.php. The response contains the flag in it.

Summary
Send request to https://ctflearn.com/header.php with this header:

User-Agent: Sup3rS3cr3tAg3nt
Referer: awesomesauce.com
