#overview
During a CTF competition, the author discovered a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in a web application that allowed them to execute arbitrary code on the server. The vulnerability was caused by a lack of input validation and sanitization in a file upload functionality. The author was able to inject malicious code into the server by uploading a specially crafted file.

#analysis
To exploit the vulnerability, the author crafted a malicious PHP file that contained a reverse shell payload. When the file was uploaded to the server, the payload was executed, allowing the author to gain remote access to the server. This vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to steal sensitive information, manipulate data, or launch further attacks on other systems connected to the server.

#attack_execution
To mitigate this vulnerability, the author recommends that the application implement proper input validation and sanitization in the file upload functionality. This includes verifying the file type and size and scanning the file for malicious code before executing it. This CTF writeup highlights the importance of properly securing web applications against RCE attacks by implementing proper input validation and sanitization measures. By exploiting the vulnerability, the author was able to demonstrate the potential risks associated with a RCE vulnerability and recommend proper countermeasures to prevent these types of attacks.
