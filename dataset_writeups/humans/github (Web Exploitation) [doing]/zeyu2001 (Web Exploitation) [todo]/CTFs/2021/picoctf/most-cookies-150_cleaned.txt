From the source code, things to note:

1\) The /display page checks the session cookie. We need to change the `very_auth` session variable to `admin` somehow.

2\) The Flask session secret key is hardcoded into the source code!

We can decode the Flask session cookie like this:

1\) Take the part before the period \(`.`\)

2\) Append the `==` padding

3\) Base64 decode:

So we can change the session variable to `admin` and encode it again, but first, we need to crack the secret key. This is because the remainder of the session cookie is the **signature** which will be checked at the server-side to prevent tampering.

The following script will bruteforce each secret in the wordlist:

Here, the secret key is `'butter'`.

With the secret key, we can craft our own session cookie:

Putting this new crafted cookie back into Burpsuite, we get the flag in the response.
