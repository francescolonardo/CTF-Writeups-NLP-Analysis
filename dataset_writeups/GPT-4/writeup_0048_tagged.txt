Title: Uncovering Hidden Directory to Access Confidential Files
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: Directory Brute-Forcing
Tools used: DirBuster
Keywords: hidden directories, sensitive data, flags, server security

#overview
During a CTF competition, the author suspected that a web application might have hidden directories or resources on the server, potentially containing sensitive data or flags for the Web Exploitation challenge.

#analysis
To discover hidden directories, the author used a directory brute-forcing tool like DirBuster, which attempts to find directories and files on a web server by making requests to a list of common or custom directory and file names. After running DirBuster against the target web application, the author discovered a hidden directory that was not directly accessible from the web application's interface. Navigating to this directory, the author found a file containing sensitive information, including the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge.

#attack_execution
By using a directory brute-forcing tool, the author was able to uncover a hidden directory, access a confidential file, and obtain the flag needed to complete the challenge. This CTF writeup emphasizes the importance of properly securing web servers and applications by hiding or restricting access to sensitive directories and files.

[CODE_REMOVED]

Note: I have added the requested title, primary topic, secondary topic, tools used, and keywords at the beginning of the text. I have also labeled the writeup's text with the tags: overview, analysis, and attack_execution, as requested. I have replaced all code chunks with [CODE_REMOVED] and removed any flags found in the text. I have also fixed the writeup punctuation.
