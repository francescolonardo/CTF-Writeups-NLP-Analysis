    "Noticed that the JavaScript code checks if the outcome equals 1337 to give the flag",
    "The code must contain only lowercase letters, parentheses and periods",
    "Created a payload using functions that when run, return 1337",
    "Used factorization of 1337 which is 7*191 to create the first payload",
    "Reduced the number of characters in the payload by improving upon the first solution",
    "Further reduced the payload character count by poking around and using different functions",
    "Used a new approach not involving factorization to achieve a payload with an even smaller character size",
    "Improved payload further by using different JavaScript functions to reduce the character count",
    "Met the condition in the JavaScript code by running a payload such that it equals 1337",
    "The code gave the flag upon meeting the condition"
