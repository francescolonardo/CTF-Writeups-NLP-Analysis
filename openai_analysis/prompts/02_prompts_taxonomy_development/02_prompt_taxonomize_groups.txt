Given a set of categories related to themes in web security, merge and distill them to produce a concise two-tiered taxonomy. This taxonomy will serve to label a dataset of actions derived from CTF writeups of web applications.

During the consolidation process, it is essential to:
1. Eliminate overly specific/generic categories.
2. Prioritize the most meaningful and representative categories for subsequent action labeling.
3. Minimize overlap between categories.
4. Avoid redundancies and repetitions.
5. Ensure that each level in the taxonomy refines and specifies the category further, showcasing a clear hierarchical distinction.

Please deliver the taxonomy as a JSON object structured in the following manner:
- Each top-level key signifies a category from the first tier.
- The value corresponding to each of these keys should be another JSON object, denoting the second tier of the taxonomy.
- The second-tier keys should house empty JSON objects as their values, ready for further refinement if necessary.

Your task is to analyze the provided categories, identify the most significant and relevant ones, and integrate them into an efficient two-tiered classification system that will serve as a guide for labeling actions based on themes in web security.
