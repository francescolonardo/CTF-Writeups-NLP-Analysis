<p>We log into the website with the provided credentials and see it says our browser is unsupported.</p>

<p>We then go into burp suite and log in to see any intermediate requests it makes.</p>

<p>There is a 302 found page with some html and javascript in it.</p>

<p>We see a scoped style attribute and a <code>navigator.battery.charging call</code> in the javascript.</p>

<p>Apparently style scoped only works in firefox 21-54, so we bruteforce user agent strings in burp suite according to this, and using version 43.0 nets us the flag.</p>

<p><code>flag is OOO{0ld@dm1nbr0wser1sth30nlyw@y}</code></p>
