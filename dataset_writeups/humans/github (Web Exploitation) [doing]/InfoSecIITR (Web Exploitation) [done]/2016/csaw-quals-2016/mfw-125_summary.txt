Discover that the website's `.git` folder is accessible, but not directly browsable or clonable.
Use the dumper from GitTools to access the repository and examine files such as `flag.php`.
Realize that the asserts in `index.php` are in strings, indicating the potential for an eval vulnerability.
Craft a page string `' and die(show_source('templates/flag.php')) or '` to exploit the vulnerability and reveal the source of `flag.php`.
Visit the URL `http://web.chal.csaw.io:8000/?page=%27%20and%20die(show_source(%27templates/flag.php%27))%20or%20%27` to run the crafted page string and obtain the flag.
Learn the lesson of never allowing user input to be `eval`d and refer to a list of exploitable PHP functions for future reference.
