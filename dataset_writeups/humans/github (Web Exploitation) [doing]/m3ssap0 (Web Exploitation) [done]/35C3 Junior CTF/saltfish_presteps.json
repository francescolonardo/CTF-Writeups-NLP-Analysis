    "Access the initial webpage, which shows a PHP snippet",
    "Analyze the PHP code for potential vulnerabilities. Ignored the first 'If' statement as it was determined to be irrelevant for the challenge",
    "Found that the second 'If' statement presented an opportunity to be bypassed. Used the same value for both the 'pass' URL parameter and the User-Agent to exploit the PHP's type conversion",
    "Approached the third 'If' statement, which appeared to be difficult to bypass due to its use of a secret flag within a MD5 calculation",
    "Deduced that the value of $_[0], which is being compared in the If statement, can only be between '0' and 'f'",
    "Tested single characters, ranging from '0' to 'f', as the value for both 'pass' and the User-Agent header",
    "Identified 'b' as the character that successfully returned the flag",
    "Retrieved the flag '35c3_password_saltf1sh_30_seconds_max'"
