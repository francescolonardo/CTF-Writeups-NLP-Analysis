    "The challenge involves a proxy server and a backend server accessible at provided URLs",
    "Inspecting the proxy reveals that it makes a request to the backend with a 'secret' token added to cookies",
    "A user-controlled 'uri' is appended to the backend URL with Python's urllib.parse.urljoin",
    "Realization that urllib.parse.urljoin doesn't handle malformed paths correctly - it can return the appended path as the base URL",
    "Using this anomaly, form a request to the proxy with the 'uri' parameter having a malformed path such as //ATTACKER-URL, causing the proxy to send a request to the specified URL",
    "The received request from the proxy contains the 'secret' cookie value",
    "By knowing the secret, now able to send a request directly to the backend server",
    "The backend checks for the 'secret' cookie before returning the flag",
    "The flag 'CTFSG{d0nT_toUcH_mY_c00k13s}' is obtained"
