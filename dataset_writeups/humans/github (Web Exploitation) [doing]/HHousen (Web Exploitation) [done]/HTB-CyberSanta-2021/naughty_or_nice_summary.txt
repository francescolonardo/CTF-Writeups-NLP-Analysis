Examine the source code, finding that both "RS256" and "HS256" algorithms are allowed for decryption.
Understand the differences between the HS256 and RS256 algorithms.
Create an account on the website, and obtain the JWT token and public key.
Tamper with the token to change the `username` to "admin" using the RS256-to-HS256 exploit.
Swap the tampered token with the non-admin token in your browser's developer tools to access the admin dashboard.
Examine the source code again to identify a potential `nunjucks` SSTI vulnerability.
Utilize a payload that breaks out of the `nunjucks` templating engine to read the flag file.
Insert the payload into one of the elf's name fields in the admin dashboard, and navigate to the homepage to reveal the flag.
