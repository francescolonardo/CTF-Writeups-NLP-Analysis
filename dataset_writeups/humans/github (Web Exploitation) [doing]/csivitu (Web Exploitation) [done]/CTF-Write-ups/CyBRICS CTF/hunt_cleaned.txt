In this challenge, you see a bunch of captcha's floating around on your screen, and the goal is to successfully get 5 captchas. There's many ways to solve this, here's what was done:

When you see the source, this is the function which creates the captchas and makes them move:
[JavaScript code: Captcha creation and movement function]

To make it easier to solve the captchas, modify this function using your browser's developer tools, removing the part where it runs the loop, which is responsible for moving the captchas.
[Modified JavaScript code: Captcha creation function without movement]

Now, you can manually add 5 captchas and get them. Just call the function `addCaptcha()` and keep clicking the boxes. When you're done with 5, click on `GET FLAG`, and copy the flag from the screen!
