### Port 10010 \[Web]

When we log into the application, we can see the following data in the page source. There seems to be a `role` attribute that we need to change, in order to escalate our privileges.

Taking a closer look at the registration fields, we see that we are submitting an `account` object with the `username` and `password` attributes.

Submitting with `account[role] = admin` changes our `role`, granting us access to `/admin`.
