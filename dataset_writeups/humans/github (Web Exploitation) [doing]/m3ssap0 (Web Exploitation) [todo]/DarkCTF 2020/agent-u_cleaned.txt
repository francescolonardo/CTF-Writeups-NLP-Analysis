Connecting to the web site will give you an authentication form with your IP printed on it. The title of the challenge seems related to the *User-Agent* string.

Analyzing the HTML source code, you can discover default credentials. Using them will print your User-Agent and an image.

The usage of `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` doesn't alter the IP address.

The challenge talks about a database, so trying to alter the User-Agent during authentication will give you a SQL error. SQL injection is possible via User-Agent string.

So you have to leak the database name. The problem is that this query is an `INSERT` one, so you need to apply an appropriate approach. You can use an [error based approach via Updatexml().

The flag is composed with the database name.
