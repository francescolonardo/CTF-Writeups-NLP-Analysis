Description
BookShelf Pico, my premium online book-reading service.
I believe that my website is super secure. I challenge you to prove me wrong by reading the 'Flag' book!
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.
Solution
After start of the instance picoCTF will provide you source code of the site and link to running instance.
Site has login screen:

And main screen with books.

We can't access any of them except the first one.
Let's dive into code.
There are some files, that are interesting to us.

Inside JwtService.java we can see all data, that JwtToken contain, the issuer and that secretGenerator gives the secret key. 

And inside the SecretGenerator.Java we see this.

So, now we know, that "secret key" is 1234. We have all the information to encode and decode JWT tokens.
But we need a userId, so let's get back to the login screen.
Now, I'm using Google chrome - press F12, open Network tab and login with creds from picoCTF: user:user, pass:user
And we will get the JWT token for our user in the payload of the response:

Copy it and go to the this website. Let's decode it like this:

So, userId is 1.
Now let's encode our JWT token with role Admin:

Inside controllers directory we can find UserController.java, where we can see this endpoint:

Now I will use Postman (because I'm lazy) and send some requests with new JWT to update our role and read the flag.
We need to create new user on the site, because we can't patch default user role.
We need to obtain users list.
First of all - put token into headers. 

Request:

Our id is 6.
Now let's patch our role:

Now we are Admin - just login and read the flag:
