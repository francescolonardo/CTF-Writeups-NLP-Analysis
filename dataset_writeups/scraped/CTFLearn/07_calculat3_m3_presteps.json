    "Understand that the challenge involves a web-based calculator capable of evaluating mathematical expressions.",
    "Interact with the calculator by inputting a random expression (e.g., '5 * 6') to observe its functionality.",
    "Use Burp Suite to intercept the request made by the calculator, focusing on the parameter handling the expression.",
    "Identify the 'expression' parameter in the intercepted request, which in this case is '5 * 6'.",
    "Test for command injection vulnerability by modifying the 'expression' parameter to a system command, such as ';ls'.",
    "Submit the modified request to execute the system command and retrieve a list of files in the server's directory.",
    "Inspect the output for filenames, identifying the flag file which starts with 'ctf'."
