This website allows you to upload LaTeX documents and to list and view your uploaded ones. The view functionality doesn't escape/encode the output and the text field where you can write your LaTeX script doesn't sanitize the input; as a consequence, the website is vulnerable to XSS.

You can abuse this, in order to print administrator cookies, with the following payload.

[LaTeX code containing a potentially malicious JavaScript script that attempts to extract the user's browser cookies.]

When the article is submitted a Warning message is shown.

Analyzing the HTML, you can discover a ref to an interesting file src.zip so you can download it.

Analyzing the source code, you can discover an interesting `if` statement, where the real flag is set into a cookie.

At this point you have already leaked the `FALSE_FLAG`, so you can force it into a cookie. You don't have `SECRET` value into your session, but you have the `PHPSESSID` of the administrator, so you can steal its session changing your cookie.

Crafting both cookies accordingly and accessing to the `list` functionality will give you the flag into the `FLAG` cookie.
