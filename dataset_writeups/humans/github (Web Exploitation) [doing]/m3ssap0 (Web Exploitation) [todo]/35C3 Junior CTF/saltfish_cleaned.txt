The page shows the PHP snippet of which is composed (I added the comments with numbers on interesting lines of code).

[PHP code with conditional statements that checks whether a given password input in the URL query parameter satisfies three conditions before outputting a secret flag. The code also includes a fallback to highlight the source code file if the password parameter is not provided.]

The `if` statement *#1* is useless for the analysis. `$_` is a normal variable populated with `pass` URL parameter content and the `@` clause does not affect anything in our scenario.

The `if` statement *#2* can be bypassed using the same value for `pass` URL parameter and for the User-Agent, because PHP's `==` gets confused with type conversions, lol.

The `if` statement *#3* contains the secret flag into a MD5 calculation, so it could seem hard to bypass, but:
* the MD5 hash can only have hex values from `0` to `f`;
* only the first char of two strings is considered in the comparison.

So the value of `$_[0]` can be between `0` and `f` only.

Trying single chars, from `0` to `f`, for the input of `pass` and User-Agent header, will reveal that `b` is the char that returns the flag.
