Seeing the description we know it should be related to jwt secret brute-forcing, anyway, let's start with it

Log in with junk value, check cookies, use [jwt.io](http://jwt.io) on token value 

On checking cookies we see there is key `token` with some value, checking it on jwt.io get this

The token is using HS256algorithm with means it is using a secret_key for encryption, on accessing `/robots.txt` we see nothing now xD

So seeing the description we know it should be related to brute-forcing for secret_key as there is nothing else xD

To do that I used  this tool [jwt_tool](https://github.com/ticarpi/jwt_tool) with `rockyou.txt`
[Command: Run jwt_tool with the target JWT token]

Now we have the secret_key which is `redraider`
So now we build a token of HS256 with secret_key as `redraider` with value of user as admin.
[Node.js script: Sign JWT token with 'redraider' as secret and use HS256 algorithm]

Now access the `/flag` using the token as cookie and we get the flag

The bug in this challenge was using a secret that could be easily cracked by brute-forcing.
