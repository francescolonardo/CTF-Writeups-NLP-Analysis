Challenge

0xeax developed the codeiiest website and hid the flag somewhere.
It is the most beautiful website I have ever seen on this planet. Why don't you visit the website and get me the flag?
Challenge running at : https://codeiiest.github.io

Solution
In the home page of the website there is the following HTML comment at the end.
```html



```
On the other page, i.e. https://codeiiest.github.io/d4rks0c1ety.html, you can find another HTML comment at the beginning.
```html



```
So the flag is the following:

accessdenied{1_w3nt_thr0ugh_th1s_w3bs1t3}
