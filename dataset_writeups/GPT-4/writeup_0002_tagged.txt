#overview
In this CTF writeup, the author describes how they bypassed client-side validation on a web application form that required an invite code for access to a restricted area of the website. The author discovered that the form validation was being performed only on the client-side using JavaScript, which can be easily manipulated.

#analysis
The author used the browser's JavaScript console to manipulate the validation function directly, bypassing the client-side validation and submitting the form without a valid invite code. They were surprised to find that they were granted access to the restricted area of the website, where they found the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge.
