Category: Web Security
Points: 50

Challenge

not pretty much many options. No need to open a link from a browser, there is always a different way
http://35.197.254.240/backtobasics

Solution
Opening the URL with browser will redirect to Google.
curl should be used to GET the page.
```
$ curl -X GET -i http://35.197.254.240/backtobasics/
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.10.3 (Ubuntu)
Date: Thu, 07 Feb 2019 20:44:45 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Connection: keep-alive
Allow: GET, POST, HEAD,OPTIONS

```
The URL seems to allow following HTTP operations: GET, POST, HEAD, OPTIONS.
Using POST will return the following.
```
$ curl -X POST -i http://35.197.254.240/backtobasics/
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.10.3 (Ubuntu)
Date: Thu, 07 Feb 2019 20:42:56 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Connection: keep-alive
Allow: GET, POST, HEAD,OPTIONS

```
The returned JavaScript can be written like the following to retrieve the flag.
```javascript
var _0x7f88=["","join","reverse","split","log","ceab068d9522dc567177de8009f323b2"];
function reverse(0xa6e5x2) {
  flag= _0xa6e5x20x7f88[3]0x7f88[2]0x7f88[1]
  console.log(flag)
}
//console[0x7f88[4]]= reverse;
//console0x7f88[4];
reverse(_0x7f88[5]);
```
The flag is the following.
