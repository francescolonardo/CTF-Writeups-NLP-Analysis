Given this attack model, you have to add for each step the following information:
- The "Taxon" field picking one from the following list : [Planning and Preparation, Information Gathering, Vulnerability Analysis, Exploitation, Post-Exploitation]. The Taxon must be the first field of the step.

Just reply with the enhanched json between backticks without further info.

Here's the model:
