    "Visited the site and analysed the given hyperlinks.",
    "Investigated behaviour of appending different strings after the '/pleb' directory in the site URL.",
    "Concluded that '/pleb' and '/pleb.' work like domain Top Level Domains (TLDs).",
    "Confirmed suspicion about server behaviour by setting up a wildcard DNS listener. Request to '/pleb.mysub.dnsbin.zhack.ca' returned DNS query for example.com.",
    "Used nip.io wildcard DNS service to exploit the redirection behaviour. Request to '/pleb.127.0.0.1.nip.io' returned localhost.",
    "Accessed the 'user' directory and found an oddly-named nginx.conf file.",
    "Set up a listener and found that the '/pleb' proxy wasn't forwarding non-ASCII characters.",
    "Used double URL encoding to bypass the character restriction and download the nginx.conf file successfully.",
    "Analysed the downloaded nginx.conf file and found that it uses proxy_pass to forward requests.",
    "Leveraged X-Accel-Redirect, which enables access to the internal directive by acting as a rewrite rule, to access the '/admin' directory.",
    "Set up a PHP script on '/pleb.my.ip.nip.io' that returned the X-Accel-Redirect header, revealing the '/admin' directory's contents.",
    "Found a flag.txt file in the '/admin' directory, but it was a misdirection towards '/useradmin'.",
    "Chose to target the '/uberadmin' directory next. Found a potential Off-by-Slash bug where nginx concatenates alias directives with location directives.",
    "Used the X-Accel-Redirect PHP script to create a request for '/admin../uberadmin/flag.txt'. This exploited the Off-by-Slash bug and returned the real flag in the 'uberadmin' directory."
