On opening the link, send an HTTP POST request using cURL with JSON data containing a username and password.
Receive a JWT token and use jwt.io to decode it, revealing a payload like `{"user":"guest"}`.
Check `robots.txt` and find the `/flag` page.
Make a POST request to `/flag` and receive a message requesting a token.
Pass the JWT token received earlier and get a response indicating it requires an admin token.
Edit the token to `{"user":"admin"}` using jwt.io and pass it to `/flag` to obtain the flag.
Understand that the bug was in the code, which only checked for the decoded value of the user to be `admin` without verifying the signature.
