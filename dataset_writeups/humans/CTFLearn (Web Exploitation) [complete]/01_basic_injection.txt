Title: Basic Injection

Just like the title said, the task involves SQL injection (SQLi). You can complete the challenge by using a simple payload such as:
' or '1'='1

The payload going to pull all the data from the database. This is because the input filed is not sanitized which makes the searching field vulnerable to the SQL injection. a hacker can pull all the information from a database that included sensitive data.

Thatâ€™s all for the simple web challenge. Bye ;)
