After registration, we get redirected to `/users/<username>/files`, where we can upload files.

By testing with two accounts, we will also find that username enumeration is possible at `/users/<username>`, since a valid username results in a 403 redirect to our own account, while an invalid username results in a 404 Not Found error.

Performing a username enumeration (using the `dirb` wordlist) yielded the following valid usernames:

* `admin`
* `root`
* `builder`
* `employee`
* `staff`

We will also find that while validation is performed on the `/users/<username>` page, the application does not check whether we are the owner of the file when we request a file at `/users/<username>/files/<filename>`. This constitutes an IDOR vulnerability.

I then scanned each username for potential files, and eventually found `/users/employee/files/fileadmin`, which was the flag.
