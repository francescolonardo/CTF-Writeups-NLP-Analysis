<p>The Challenge contains a python file,
On opening the python file u can clearly see som regex fu going on:</p>

<p>going through the code and testing it on the live link, u can see that it ignores the first letter if its upper case, and makes a logic around it. Its better if u view it in a debugging tool , I use regex101</p>

<p>I also went through the official documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) to see if there are any special characters that can be used. the most interesting one was <code>|</code>
As per the documentation:</p>

<p><code>
|
A|B, where A and B can be arbitrary REs, creates a regular expression that will match either A or B. An arbitrary number of REs can be separated by the '|' in this way. This can be used inside groups (see below) as well. As the target string is scanned, REs separated by '|' are tried from left to right. When one pattern completely matches, that branch is accepted. This means that once A matches, B will not be tested further, even if it would produce a longer overall match. In other words, the '|' operator is never greedy. To match a literal '|', use \|, or enclose it inside a character class, as in [|].
</code></p>

<p>Once u go through it with a <code>flag{randomString}</code> u will find that the following regex would allow it. </p>

<p>So now we remove our initial regex and just add the ones we used aka <code>|flag{.*}|</code>
which gives u the flag</p>
