Identified a simple page that takes a URL and submits it, likely an XSS challenge.
Determined that the bot probably only visits its own URL.
Analyzed the source code of index.html and identified a function that loads scripts or iframes and an event listener for messages.
Observed the validation checks in the JavaScript code and determined that data URIs can bypass these checks.
Crafted a payload using a data URI to create an XMLHttpRequest that sends the bot's cookie to an external server.
Sent the final link containing the payload to the bot, which triggered the XSS and resulted in receiving the flag on the external server.
