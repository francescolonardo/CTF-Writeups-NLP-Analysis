    "Discover that the search parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks",
    "Create a script to send specially crafted SQL queries to the application and monitor the response time",
    "If the query returns true, the response time is longer than if the query returns false.",
    "Use the difference in response time to determine whether the query was successful or not",
