We need to break through the `verify()` function.

First, `verifyUsername()` is a simple string comparison.

Second, `verifyPassword()` is a password inspection using bcrypt.

This hash is well known in [PHP manual](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.password-verify.php).

The password is `rasmuslerdorf`.

And finally, `verifyMFA()` is inspection of a number that is 10 digit random number.

This is very difficult to break through. However, the variable `mfa` is created by unserializing user requests.

So, it is possible to determine that `mfa` and `_correctValue` match by using `mfa` as the reference of `_correctValue` by object injection.

Answer is

And create userdata parameter by base64 encoding.
