Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: SQL Injection
Tools used: SQLMap
Keywords: quotes, UNION attack

#context
This challenge is a website with a single input where we can search for an id.

#discovery
I'll check if the input is vulnerable. From the description you'll notice that there's SQLi. To check if the ID field is vulnerable to SQLi, the first payload I used was a simple 1', which returned no results. Then I tried 1 OR 1=1. It worked but did not give me anything interesting, so the flag must be somewhere else in the database. I started suspecting that the quotes character is blacklisted.

#discovery
Finding how many columns the query needs. Next, I started to look for how many columns the query needs to work. This information will be needed in a UNION attack.

#exploitation
So at this point, I just use SQLMap to enumerate the db. 

#countermeasures
We must first extract the names of the existing databases. The next step is to extract the database information (table, columns, flag).
