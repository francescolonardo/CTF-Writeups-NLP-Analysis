The following json is a step extracted from an attack model obtained from a CTF's writeup.

{
    "StepNumber": 1,
    "Description": "Bypass cookie-based authentication",
    "ToolsUsed": null,
    "StepDetails": {
        "Hypothesis": "The attacker wants to gain access to the restricted page by bypassing the cookie-based authentication.",
        "Action": "Set the 'password' cookie to the value 'w0rdc0unt123' to impersonate a user from 'csivit'.",
        "Result": "Successfully bypasses authentication and gains access to the page.",
        "Success": "Success",
        "FailingReason": null
    }
}

Given this step, I need to extract a more structured source of information.
Use this json as guide:
{
    "SubStep": [
    {
        "Subject": "Who performs this action?",
        "Target": "The action has a target?",
        "TypeOfAction": "Which type of action has been performed?",
        "GainedResources": "What the subject gained from this action?
    }, //Add more substeps as needed
    ]

}
