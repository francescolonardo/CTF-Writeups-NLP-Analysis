Title: Bypassing Client-Side Validation to Discover Hidden Flag

During a CTF competition, I encountered a web application that featured a form requiring users to input a specific code to access a restricted area where the flag was hidden. The form relied on client-side JavaScript validation to check if the code was correct. This piqued my interest, as client-side validation can often be bypassed to gain unauthorized access.

To bypass the client-side validation, I inspected the source code of the web page and located the JavaScript file responsible for validating the user input. I then examined the validation function to understand its logic and identify any weaknesses.

I discovered that the validation function checked if the user input matched a hardcoded value. Knowing this, I could simply input the correct value directly into the form without having to reverse-engineer the validation function further.

Once I entered the correct code into the form, I was granted access to the restricted area, where I found the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge.

This CTF writeup highlights the importance of using server-side validation in addition to client-side validation for securing web applications. By bypassing the client-side validation, I was able to gain unauthorized access to the restricted area and retrieve the flag needed to complete the challenge.
