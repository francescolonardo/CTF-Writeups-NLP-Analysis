The challenge will print a PHP source code.

[PHP code that checks if the 'start' parameter has been sent via GET request, and if not, displays the source code of the current file and exits. If 'start' is present in a POST request, it includes the corresponding file and echoes the value of a variable named '$secret'.]

You can craft a request like the following.

[HTTP POST request with specific headers and body content includes a parameter called "start" with a value of "/var/www/html/flag.php".]

The server responds with an HTTP 200 OK status code and returns a text/html response containing a flag.
