This Python script demonstrates an SQL Injection attack against the web application's database to solve the "Taxi Union" and "Gate Keeper" challenges. The script performs the following steps:
[Import the necessary libraries and initialize the variables.
Set the appropriate URL, check string, key, and column values based on the selected challenge (either "Taxi Union" or "Gate Keeper").
Iterate through each character in the domain (letters, digits, and special characters) while searching for the flag.
For each character, create an SQL injection payload that checks if the current flag value concatenated with the character is a prefix of the targeted column's value.
Send an HTTP POST request to the URL with the payload as the form data.
If the check string is found in the response, it means the character is part of the flag. Add the character to the flag and continue iterating through the domain.
Repeat the process until the entire flag is discovered.]

The Python script helps to find the flag by exploiting SQL injection vulnerability in the web application.
