The page shows the PHP snippet of which is composed and an image.

The PHP code is the following.

[PHP code that retrieves an image file based on the user's preferred language. The code is vulnerable to directory traversal attacks since it does not properly sanitize the input received from the user.]

The web site extracts the language passed via HTTP header, considers the first language and tries to load a picture from the `flags` folder; that picture will be displayed.

Even if the `str_replace('../', '', $lang)` instruction is used, the path traversal vulnerability is still present and can be abused using `....//` instead of `../`.

After some attempts, you will discover the correct HTTP header to use.

[HTTP header tampering attempt with path traversal payload to potentially retrieve a flag]

The returned "image" will be the following.

``[HTML image tag with base64-encoded JPEG data]

Decoding the Base64 will give you the flag.
