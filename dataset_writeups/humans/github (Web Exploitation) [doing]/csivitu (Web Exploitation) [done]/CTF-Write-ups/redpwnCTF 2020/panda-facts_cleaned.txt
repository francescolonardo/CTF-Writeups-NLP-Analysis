[This challenge involves exploiting a vulnerability in the `generateToken` function in a JavaScript file. The function generates a token for a given `username`, where the `username` is included as a string in a JSON object that is encrypted using `aes-192-cbc`. However, the function forms the JSON object in a way that allows the " character to be closed with the help of the string passed in the `username` parameter, and sets the `member` field to a non-zero value.]

You really just need to notice this function. Notice, the token is not created like `token.username = username`. It's formed in the following way:
```
const token = `{"integrity":"${INTEGRITY}","member":0,"username":"${username}"}`
```

To exploit the vulnerability, we can pass the `username` as `","member":"1` which will close the `"` character and set `member` to `1`. Then, we can visit `/api/flag` to get the flag in JSON format.
