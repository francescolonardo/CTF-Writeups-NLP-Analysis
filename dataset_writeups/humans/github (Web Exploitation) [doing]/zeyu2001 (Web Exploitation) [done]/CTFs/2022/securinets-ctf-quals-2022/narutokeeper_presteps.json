    "First step: Analyzed the challenge website where notes could be created and searched.",
    "Second step: Investigated the search function which uses a 302 server-side redirect to '/view' if a note matching the query is found.",
    "Third step: Discovered that an oracle could be used to determine whether the flag obtained is correct.",
    "Fourth step: Confirmed that the SameSite attribute of the cookies is set to None.",
    "Fifth step: Researched the Fetch API's limit of 20 redirects before a network error is returned.",
    "Sixth step: Identified an exploit: if a 302 redirect is detected this indicates that the flag leaks due to the network error from exceeding the Fetch API redirect limit.",
    "Seventh step: Created an attacker server to make 19 redirects.",
    "Eighth step: Made the attacker server redirect to the target URL after 19 redirects.",
    "Nineth step: Utilized script to make the client request to exploit the limit of 20 redirects using Fetch API.",
    "Tenth step: Created a PHP script to redirect to itself 19 times, before redirecting to the target URL.",
    "Eleventh step: Tested this method to successfully bruteforce the flag letter by letter."
