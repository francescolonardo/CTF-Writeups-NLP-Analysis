    "Identified the end goal, i.e., is to get access to /flag. The JWT token has a role attribute that needs to be changed to admin before you can proceed.",
    "The registration and login process was then studied. The JWT key was created for each new user during the registration process. This JWT key was used to sign the token when the user logs in.",
    "Identified that there is a caching mechanism where each user's JWT key is stored in a Redis cache after logging in. Noticed that the key is only stored for 2 seconds.",
    "Explored the non-admin path, /sakura that allows interaction with the Redis cache. But the process only permits requests from a client URL validated to be 127.0.0.1.",
    "Identified /rin that uses SSRF code. The server checks the X-Forwarded-For header to validate the client IP.",
    "Realized that by adding X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1, an SSRF is possible to the /sakura endpoint. As the cached secret is only available for 2 seconds after logging in, the SSRF request must be made immediately after login.",
    "Used the JWT secret to create a JWT with the admin role using https://jwt.io/ or a JWT-signing library.",
    "By using the new admin JWT token, made a request to /flag to get the flag."
