Title: Some Assembly Required 1

Upon visiting the website, it appears to just be a textbox with a form.
After inspecting the website, I can see there's a JavaScript file. I inspect that file.
The first time I looked at it I gave up in 5 seconds. Anyways, in the const declaration one of the elements caught my attention. There is a path.
I visited that path and it gave a WebAssembly file.
At the bottom of the file, there was the flag.
