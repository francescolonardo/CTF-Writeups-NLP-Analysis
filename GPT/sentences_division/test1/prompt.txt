Giving the following CTF's writeup, I want you to extract all the sentences that can fit one of this category:

- Descriptive Sentences: These sentences provide descriptions or explanations.
- Directive Sentences: These sentences instruct the reader on actions to take.
- Narrative Sentences: These sentences describe a series of actions or events.
- Expository Sentences: These sentences provide information or explanations.
- Miscellaneous Sentences: These sentences contain additional information.

Then put them into a json that has this structure:

{
    "sentences": [
        { 
            "sentence": {
                "content": "The actual content of the sentence",
                "type_of_sentence": "Descriptive, Directive, Narrative, Expository, Misc"
            }

        },
    ]
}
