NaaS
It was a basic task for cracking the Python's random generator. The solution was to request enough nonces from https://naas.2019.chall.actf.co/nonceify to predict the upcoming ones. To crack the random generator I used the tool: https://github.com/tna0y/Python-random-module-cracker. 
After successful prediction of the nonces you only had to create a paste with <script nonce=Nonce1></script><script nonce=Nonce2></script><script nonce=Nonce3></script>... so you can be sure that when the admin visits the page one of them will work.
After getting the admin's cookie we get the flag: actf{lotsandlotsofnonces}
