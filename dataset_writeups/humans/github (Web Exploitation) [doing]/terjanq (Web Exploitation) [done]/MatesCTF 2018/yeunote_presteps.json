    "Checked for a possibility of XSS injection in the CSRF token script.",
    "Checked the site's 'Bug Bounty' form which sends suspicious URLs to be visited by a headless Chrome agent.",
    "Attempted to utilize CSRF mechanism to gain admin access.",
    "Created a CSRF page that attempts to add the attacker's email to the admin's shared note.",
    "Used <meta name='referrer' content='no-referrer'> to bypass the restriction caused by the referrer header.",
    "Overwrote document.domain using Object.defineProperty(document, 'domain', {value: 'yeunote.ctf.yeuchimse.com'});",
    "Constructed a post form to add the attacker's email (my_email@foo.com) to the admin's shared list.",
    "Managed to access the admin's note but faced a password prompt.",
    "Noticed that clicking on 'Facebook', 'Google' or 'Twitter' buttons attaches the note id and password to the shared URL.",
    "Tried to implement a similar mechanism to the CSRF mechanism used earlier to grab the password.",
    "Attempted to log in the admin to a dummy Twitter account and share the password.",
    "Noticed an undeleted Tweet that contains the password by another user.",
    "Tried different versions of the Twitter login page to authenticate on behalf of the admin without success.",
    "Tried to generate 'oauth tokens' for the flag note in order to share the generated URL with the admin.",
    "Found out it is achievable by making two additional GET requests: 'GET https://yeunote.ctf.yeuchimse.com/note/twitter/3' and 'GET https://yeunote.ctf.yeuchimse.com/note/twitter?oauth_token=<oauth token>&oauth_verifier=<oauth verifier>'.",
    "Intercepted 'oauth tokens' by stopping the request from 'twitter' to 'yeunote' before it gets executed using burp tool."
