The website simulates a guessing game where the target is to guess the random token (100 chars) generated for your IP address in order to read the flag.

The challenge gives you some files with the source code.

Analyzing the source code you can discover, into `play.php`, a query vulnerable to SQL injection.

Nothing is printed to output as result of the query, except for different messages when the query returns rows and when no rows are returned. 

These are the prerequisites for a blind SQL injection. Data could be exfiltrated, one char at a time, using `LIKE` statement.

The problem is that a limit for the number of the attempts is present (max 10 attempts). At the end of the attempts, the token will be reset. So it's impossible, from the same IP where the token was generated, to discover the token.

The solution is obvious: you have to generate the token from one IP, then you have to change the IP to discover the previous generated token.

Please consider that the specified IP must be the one for which the token was generated, not the attacking one!

A Python script can be written to discover the token.

At the end the of the process, you can insert the token in the form at the following page. Be sure to use the IP for which the token was generated.

The page will give you the flag.
