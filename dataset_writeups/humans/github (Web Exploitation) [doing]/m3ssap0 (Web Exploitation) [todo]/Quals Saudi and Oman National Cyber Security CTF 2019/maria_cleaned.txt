curl will return a web page.

At the beginning of the HTML page you can find a sql query with your IP address in it.

Using the `X-FORWARDED-FOR` HTTP header that parameter can be manipulated, furthermore it is vulnerable to SQL injection.

The database seems to be a SQLite.

After some analysis you can discover that the result of the executed query is used to populate the `PHPSESSID` cookie.

Crafting a `UNION` SQL operation with `null` allows you to discover the user table and the number of columns to union.

Furthermore, you can discover which is the position of the column used to return data.

Now you can extract information and see results into `PHPSESSID` cookie.

You can discover that there are only two tables..

Flag could be into Maria's record, so you can enumerate colums of user table.

Unfortunately passwords are random numbers, so they are not related to the flag. Nothing interesting found into the user table, even into other user records. Probably the flag is into the sessions table. 

Analyzing the composition of the sessions table you can discover that you need a value for the `user_id` column which is the foreign key to the user table.

The `id` of Maria can be easily retrieved from user table.

At this point you can find Maria's session ID.

This is not the flag, but only Maria can see the flag, so you can impersonate Maria changing your `PHPSESSID` cookie into your browser.

This will reveal the flag refreshing the page.
