Title: Command Injection in a File Upload
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: Command Injection
Tools used: None
Keywords: file upload, input validation, sanitation, payload, privileges, server, attacker, sensitive data, further attacks, types of files, content scanning

#overview
During a CTF competition, the author discovered a command injection vulnerability in a file upload feature of a web application. The file upload feature allowed users to upload files to the server, and the application processed the uploaded files without proper input validation.

#analysis
The author crafted a malicious file with a specially-crafted filename that included a command injection payload. By uploading this file to the server, they were able to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the web application. This vulnerability could have allowed an attacker to take control of the server, access sensitive data, or launch further attacks on other systems connected to the server.

#attack_execution
To mitigate this vulnerability, the author recommended that the application implement proper input validation and sanitation techniques to prevent command injection attacks. The application should also restrict the types of files that can be uploaded and implement file content scanning to prevent the upload of malicious files.

This CTF writeup highlights the importance of properly securing file upload features in web applications by implementing proper input validation and sanitation techniques to prevent command injection attacks. By exploiting the vulnerability, the author was able to demonstrate the potential risks associated with a command injection vulnerability and recommend proper countermeasures to prevent these types of attacks.
