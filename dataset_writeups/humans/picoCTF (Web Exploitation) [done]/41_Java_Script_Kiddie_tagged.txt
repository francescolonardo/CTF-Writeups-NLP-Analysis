#context
Get a look at the webpage source code.

#discovery
Run:
```
$.get("bytes", function(resp) {bytes = Array.from(resp.split(" "), x => Number(x));});
```
from the source code in developer console to get a list of bytes.

#exploitation
The website takes the above list of bytes and shifts them based on the key the user enters. For each character in the key, the script shifts every 16th byte starting with byte i, where i is the index of the character in the key. In this way, the first 16 bytes of the image correspond to the 16 digits in the user-specified key.

#code
I used a script that, for each character of the key, will try all digits until one is found that places the expected value in the current location.

#countermeasures
Enter key into website and save the QRCode PNG image.

#code
Use zbar on the image to get the flag.
