The title reminds the XSS vulnerability.

The page can be used to post a message with an XSS attack. For example using an `img` tag like the following.

[HTML code for an image element with a "src" attribute pointing to "foo.png". The "onerror" attribute is set to execute JavaScript code that redirects the user to a specific URL while appending the document's cookie as a parameter.]

The website will return a code that can be used to identify the posted message.

The resulting code can be sent to administrator via the report page.

On a server listening with `nc`, you will receive the admin cookies.

[Terminal output showing a network connection being established and a GET request being made with various HTTP headers and parameters.]

Then the cookie can be used to perform a request to the admin page.

[HTTP request and response headers and body for a web page. The response body contains HTML code for an admin landing page with a secret cookie authentication system.]

The flag is the following.
