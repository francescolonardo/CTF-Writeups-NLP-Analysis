    "Step 1: The author identifies it as a SQL Injection challenge and sets up the environment to exploit it.",
    "Step 2: Para meters and values such as 'domain', 'check', 'key', and 'column' are initialized to be manipulated later.",
    "Step 3: The author sets a condition to set these parameters based on the specific challenge, as this solution also works for the 'Gate Keeper' challenge.",
    "Step 4: While the condition to receive the CTF password (flag) not met, the script will continue iterating.",
    "Step 5: In each iteration, the author forms SQL Injection payload with progressively appended characters from the 'domain'.",
    "Step 6: The payload is sent to the target URL via POST request. The data content for the request is constructed dynamically with the key-value pair where the key is retrieved from the 'key' variable and the value is the payload.",
    "Step 7: A check is performed to see if the response text contains 'check', a predefined string that is expected in the response of the successful login.",
    "Step 8: If the check is successful, it indicates that the payload was able to pass through SQL Injection leading to valid login and the iterated character is added to 'flag'.",
    "Step 9: The 'flag' value updates with the successful character, and it repeats the process until the end of the flag is found."
