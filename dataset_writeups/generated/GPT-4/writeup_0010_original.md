Title: Bypassing Client-Side Validation for Hidden Flag Retrieval

During a CTF event, I came across a web application that featured a registration form with strict client-side validation. I noticed that some fields had specific requirements, such as the email address domain and the password's length and complexity. This scenario led me to believe that bypassing the client-side validation could potentially reveal a hidden flag.

To test my hypothesis, I inspected the source code of the web page and identified the JavaScript functions responsible for the client-side validation. I then used the browser's developer tools to disable these functions and proceeded to submit the registration form with non-compliant input values.

Upon submitting the form with the client-side validation disabled, the application returned a response that included a hidden message with the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge. The flag had been concealed within the server-side validation logic and was only revealed when the client-side validation was bypassed.

This CTF writeup emphasizes the importance of implementing robust server-side validation and not solely relying on client-side validation for security. By bypassing the client-side validation, I was able to uncover the hidden flag and complete the challenge.
