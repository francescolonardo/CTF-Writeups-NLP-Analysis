Challenge

People are getting online here, but the page doesn't seem to be implemented...I ran a pcap to see what I could find out.
http://freewifi.ctf.umbccd.io/
Authors: pleoxconfusa and freethepockets

Solution
The HTML code of the page is the following.
```html




Guest Sign In Portal


<!-- Bootstrap -->
<link href="/static/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css?bootstrap=3.3.7.1.dev1" rel="stylesheet">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/main.css">






Sorry!


Guest login
Guest sign in portal is not yet implemented.




<script src="/static/bootstrap/jquery.min.js?bootstrap=3.3.7.1.dev1"></script>
<script src="/static/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js?bootstrap=3.3.7.1.dev1"></script>



```
So there is anything to authenticate there.
Analyzing the PCAP file you can discover on packet #6 the existence of https://freewifi.ctf.umbccd.io/staff.html web page.
Connecting to it, you will discover the flag.
