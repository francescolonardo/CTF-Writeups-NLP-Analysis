Title: Remote Code Execution (RCE) Attack via File Upload
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: Remote Code Execution
Tools used: None
Keywords: file upload, PHP code, web shell, payload, command execution

#context
During a CTF competition, I encountered a web application that allowed users to upload and manage files. Given the potential security risks associated with file uploads, I suspected that the application might be vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE), a type of vulnerability that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.

#discovery
To test for RCE, I crafted a malicious file containing PHP code, such as a web shell, and uploaded it to the application. If the application allowed me to execute the code and obtain remote access to the server, it would confirm the presence of an RCE vulnerability.

#exploitation
Upon uploading the crafted file to the application, it indeed allowed me to execute the PHP code and obtain remote access to the server, confirming the vulnerability. To obtain the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge, I needed to use the RCE vulnerability to execute a specific command on the server.

#code
`After researching the server's configuration and available commands, I crafted a suitable payload containing the desired command and uploaded it to the application, which executed the command and displayed the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge.`

#countermeasures
This CTF writeup highlights the importance of properly securing web applications against RCE vulnerabilities by validating and sanitizing user input, using file type validation and content inspection, and restricting file permissions and execution. By exploiting the RCE vulnerability, I was able to execute arbitrary code, obtain remote access to the server, and obtain the flag needed to complete the challenge.
