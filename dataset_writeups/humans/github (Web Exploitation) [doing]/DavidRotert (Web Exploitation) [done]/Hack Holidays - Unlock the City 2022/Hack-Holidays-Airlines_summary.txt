Perform a code review, finding a security advisory related to "Code Execution through IIFE in node-serialize".
Investigate the `unserialize()` function as a potential vulnerability.
Examine the database structure and contents using "DB Browser for SQLite".
Review the source code, particularly the route handling files, and find where `unserialize()` is used.
Test basic serialization and unserialization with a simple payload in a separate JavaScript file.
Craft a malicious payload that reads the flag file and returns it as a username.
Set the resulting payload as the `session` cookie to execute the attack.
Successfully obtain the flag by attacking the sandbox.
After solving the challenge, create a better solution by serializing the payload using node-serialize, modifying it, and unserializing it to get the flag.
