Title: Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Command Injection in a Web Application

During a CTF competition, I encountered a web application that included a search feature allowing users to search for information on the server. Given the potential security risks associated with Command Injection vulnerabilities, I suspected that the application might be vulnerable to RCE attacks.

To test for Command Injection vulnerabilities, I entered a payload containing a command injection, such as ;ls -la;, into the search field. Upon submitting the form, the application accepted the payload and displayed the results of the command, indicating that the application was vulnerable to Command Injection attacks.

To demonstrate the potential risks associated with Command Injection, I crafted a payload that would allow me to execute arbitrary commands on the server. This payload included a command to download and execute a reverse shell script from an attacker-controlled server.

This payload allowed me to execute arbitrary commands on the server and demonstrate the potential risks associated with Command Injection attacks.

This CTF writeup highlights the importance of properly securing web applications against Command Injection vulnerabilities by implementing proper input validation and output encoding controls, using parameterized queries, and validating user input. By exploiting the vulnerability, I was able to execute arbitrary commands on the server, demonstrate the potential risks associated with Command Injection attacks, and recommend proper countermeasures to prevent these types of attacks.
