Title: Cookie Manipulation for Privilege Escalation
Topics: Web Exploitation
Vulnerabilities: Cookie Manipulation, Privilege Escalation
Tools used: Browser Developer Tools
Keywords: user_role, admin access, sensitive information

#context
During a recent CTF competition, I encountered a web application that allowed users to log in and view their account information. 

#discovery
After registering a regular user account, I started to analyze the cookies being set by the application. Upon logging in, I noticed a cookie named user_role with a value of user. This immediately caught my attention, as the cookie's name suggested that it might be related to user privileges.

#exploitation
I decided to manipulate the cookie value to see if I could escalate my privileges within the application. Using browser developer tools, I modified the user_role cookie value to admin and refreshed the page. Surprisingly, the application didn't seem to have any server-side validation of the cookie value, and I was granted admin access. With admin access, I was able to view sensitive information that was restricted to regular users. This allowed me to complete the Web Exploitation challenge by finding the flag hidden in the restricted admin area.

#countermeasures
In conclusion, this CTF writeup demonstrates the importance of server-side validation for cookies and user input. By simply manipulating a cookie value, I was able to escalate my privileges and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. To prevent this type of attack, web developers should implement server-side validation of cookies and user input to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive information.
