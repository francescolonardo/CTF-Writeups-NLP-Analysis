Title: My Blog

This is a kind of very unique challenge. No vulnerability, no bug, just a clean blog site. Instead of a complete CTF challenge, this is a test of web development knowledge.

If you read the text carefully, "you may find a good application for your memory." That is a hint for the challenge. When the dev talked about memory, it must be something to do with the storage.

Question is, how do we access the storage? It is simple, for Firefox browser, open the Developer Tools and go to storage.

I find the flag in the storage.
