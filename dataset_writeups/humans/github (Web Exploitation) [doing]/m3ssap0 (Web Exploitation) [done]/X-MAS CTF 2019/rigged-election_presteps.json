    "Analyzed the website behavior and noticed that an idea can be posted with an assigned ID that can be voted on.",
    "Examined HTML source code to understand the layout and elements of the webpage and its voting system.",
    "Reviewed JavaScript 'index.js' to understand the methods used for voting.",
    "Identification of a voting procedure challenge that requires solving. A string has to be found so that the MD5 hash of this string exactly matches the challenge.",
    "Noticed that each challenge string must be found every time it is called, which can be optimized.",
    "Wrote a script to use a cache which stores all attempts for generating the challenge strings.",
    "Implemented a smart voter script that utilizes a previously saved cache. This minimizes the time spent on creating strings that match the challenge given by the server.",
    "Script causes browser to begin voting process. Process continues until more than 250 votes are cast during the same PHP session.",
    "Observed that obtaining the flag message requires waiting for a response from the server after each vote.",
    "After reaching 250 votes, flag message is returned by the server."
