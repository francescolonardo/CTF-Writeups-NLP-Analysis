#context
A simple command injection challenge will be demonstrated in this walkthrough. The site gives a calculator that you can click the buttons to input expression, then it will eval the expression and gives a result.

#discovery
I provided random input in this calculator and intercepted the request with BurpSuite. I got one parameter taking the values: expression: 5 * 6 

#exploitation
Try to get the contents in directory, set the expression to ;ls. Submit it to get a list of file names in result, the flag is the one starts with ctf.

#code
;ls

#countermeasures
This challenge demonstrates the importance of properly validating user input and preventing command injection attacks. It also highlights the need for secure coding practices and regular security testing to identify and address vulnerabilities in web applications.
