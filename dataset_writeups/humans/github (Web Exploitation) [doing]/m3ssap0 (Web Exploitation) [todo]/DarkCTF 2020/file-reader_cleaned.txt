The web site is a form to upload files. Reading the challenge description, an XXE should be involved.

The form allows only PDF and DOCX files.

Uploading a DOCX file, you can notice that some information are shown. One of them is the number of pages.

DOCX files are archives of files where XML documents are present.

It is sufficient to create a DOCX and to alter the app.xml file, where the number of pages is stored.

Uploading the file in the web application will return the flag where the number of pages is shown.
