Title: The Forgotten Password
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: Password Cracking
Tools used: Hydra, John the Ripper
Keywords: Linux server, password hash, brute-force

#overview
The challenge is to log in as a specific user on a website for which we don't have the password. The login page appears to be a basic HTML page with two fields: one for the username and one for the password. There is no option to reset the password, so we will need to crack it.

#analysis
After some reconnaissance, we find out that the website is running on a Linux server, and that the password is not very strong. We can use Hydra and John the Ripper to crack the password.

#attack_execution
First, we use Hydra to brute-force the password. We specify the username and a list of common passwords to try. After a few minutes, Hydra successfully finds the password.

Next, we use John the Ripper to crack the password hash. We download the password hash from the website, and then use John the Ripper to try to crack it. After a few minutes, John the Ripper successfully cracks the password.

With the password in hand, we can now log in as the specific user and complete the challenge.
