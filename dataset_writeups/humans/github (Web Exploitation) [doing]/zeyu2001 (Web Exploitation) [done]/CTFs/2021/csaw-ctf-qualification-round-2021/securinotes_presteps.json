    "Access and inspect the front-end JavaScript source code",
    "Identify that Meteor is being used to fetch data from a MongoDB backend",
    "Discover all the exposed Meteor methods including 'notes.count', 'notes.add', and 'notes.remove'",
    "Observe that 'notes.count' function is unauthenticated",
    "Understand that 'notes.count' applies a filter and returns the count of notes that pass this filter",
    "Use Burp Suite to find that this method is being executed through websockets",
    "Deduce that the '$ne' filter checks if the body of the notes is not empty",
    "Understand '$regex' is acceptable, allowing regex patterns for note contents",
    "Check for notes that match the regex pattern 'flag{.*}', testing the filter",
    "Validate that only one result is returned, indicating only one note contains the flag",
    "Use this technique to bruteforce every character of the flag",
    "Concatenate possible characters to the end of the flag",
    "For each possible character, check if it is part of the flag by verifying if the count returns 1",
    "Output the character if it returns a count larger than 0",
    "Repeat this until the entire flag ('flag{4lly0Urb4s3}') is discovered"
