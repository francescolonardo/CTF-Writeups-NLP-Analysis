A. Reconnaissance, Gathering, Analysis & Assessment
    
    Information Gathering & Exploration
        Reconnaissance & Identification: Observing and gathering initial information about the target to understand its structure, components, and functionalities.
        Source Code Inspection: Analyzing application source codes to understand the logic, functionalities, and potential weak points.
        User & Behavior Analysis: Examining how the application behaves upon user interaction and identifying any anomalous outcomes.
        Network & Database Interaction Analysis: Investigating the structure and interactions of databases and examining client-server communication.
        Data Exploration & Interpretation: Extracting and interpreting acquired data for sensitive information or potential vulnerabilities.

    Vulnerability & Configuration Assessment
        Vulnerability Analysis: Identifying and analyzing vulnerabilities by examining server responses, headers, and website functionalities.
        Authentication & Session Analysis: Assessing authentication mechanisms and session-related data to identify potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
        System & Configuration Analysis: Evaluating system configurations and setups to identify potential misconfigurations and weaknesses.

    Dependency & External Resource Analysis
        Library & Dependency Analysis: Investigating specific libraries or dependencies to identify related vulnerabilities or weaknesses.
        External Resource Analysis: Interacting with and analyzing external data sources or third-party platforms to gather additional information or identify potential security implications.

B. Crafting, Manipulation, Injection & Exploitation

    Exploitation & Attack Techniques
        Authentication & Session Exploitation: Manipulating authentication mechanisms and session data to bypass security checks and restrictions.
