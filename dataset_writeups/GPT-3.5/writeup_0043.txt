Title: "XXE Attack on a Web Service"

During a CTF competition, I discovered an XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in a web service that allowed users to submit XML data. The web service parsed the XML data without proper validation and sanitation, allowing me to submit a crafted XML document that included a reference to an external entity.

By submitting the crafted XML document, I was able to read sensitive system files, including configuration files and password hashes, by exploiting the XXE vulnerability. This allowed me to gain unauthorized access to the system and potentially compromise its security.

To mitigate this vulnerability, I recommended that the application implement proper input validation and sanitation techniques to prevent XXE attacks. The application should also disable external entity references in the XML parser or use a secure XML parser library that prevents XXE attacks.

This CTF writeup highlights the importance of properly securing web services that accept XML data by implementing proper input validation and sanitation techniques to prevent XXE attacks. By exploiting the vulnerability, I was able to demonstrate the potential risks associated with an XXE vulnerability and recommend proper countermeasures to prevent these types of attacks.
