<h2>Key-Lottery</h2>

<p>We have a simple website which asks for Keys and gives a set of rule.
“Keys should be sent as comma separated string of key guesses. Letters and digits only. No spaces.”
We also have an attachment server.py</p>

<p>Now first we tried many diffrent chars like $,% etc, but we got an error</p>

<p>In the attachment file we see:
“/guess?keys=key0,key1,key2”
here we know that we need 3 keys.</p>

<p>After entering many different combination of inputs, we thought of using just comma as input.
At first we entered a single comma we got:</p>

<p>Now i though of giving 3 comma’s as input, as we have 3 keys:</p>

<p>And we got:</p>

<p>that looks like a character set.
So i tried using this a the input with 3 comma’s so as to complete the requirement:</p>

<p>And here we have the flag:</p>
