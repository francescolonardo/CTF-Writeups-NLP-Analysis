Title: JaWT Scratchpad
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: JWT
Tools used: hashcat

#context
The challenge involves a web application that uses JWT for authentication.

#discovery
The first step is to log in as any user and obtain the JWT token from the jwt cookie.

#exploitation
Next, we use hashcat to crack the token and obtain the password used. We then change the "user" in the JWT payload to "admin" and sign it again using the password found.

#code
`hashcat -m 16500 token.txt rockyou.txt`

#countermeasures
This challenge highlights the importance of properly securing JWT tokens and avoiding common vulnerabilities such as weak passwords. It also emphasizes the need for proper access control and user authentication mechanisms.
