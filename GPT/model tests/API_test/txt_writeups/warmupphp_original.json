    "Steps": [
      {
        "StepNumber": 1,
        "Description": "The attacker recognizes that the PHP script uses YAML parsing to check if the IP is from Norway.",
        "ToolsUsed": null,
        "StepDetails": {
          "Hypothesis": "The attacker hypothesizes that the YAML parsing issue can be exploited to bypass the escapeshellargs protection.",
          "Action": "The attacker crafts an IP address from Norway and sends it to the target application.",
          "Result": "The YAML parsing issue treats 'NO' as False, allowing the attacker to bypass the escapeshellargs protection.",

          "FailingReason": null

        "StepNumber": 2,
        "Description": "The attacker attempts command injection to execute arbitrary commands on the target system.",
        "ToolsUsed": null,
        "StepDetails": {
          "Hypothesis": "The attacker believes that command injection can be performed due to the absence of proper input sanitization.",
          "Action": "The attacker injects a malicious command into the input field.",
          "Result": "The injected command is successfully executed on the target system.",
          "Success": "Success",
          "FailingReason": null

        "StepNumber": 3,
        "Description": "The attacker exploits the command injection vulnerability to gain unauthorized access or perform further malicious activities.",
        "ToolsUsed": null,
        "StepDetails": {
          "Hypothesis": "The attacker expects to be able to achieve their goal of unauthorized access or further exploitation through the command injection vulnerability.",
          "Action": "The attacker leverages the command injection to execute additional commands or launch further attacks.",
          "Result": "The attacker successfully gains unauthorized access or performs further malicious activities.",
