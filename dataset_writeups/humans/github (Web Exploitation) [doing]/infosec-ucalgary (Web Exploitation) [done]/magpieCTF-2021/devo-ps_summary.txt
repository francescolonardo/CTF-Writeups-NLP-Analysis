The challenge involves a misconfigured GitHub Actions build script in the 'magpie-inc/flag-checker' repo.
Examine 'flagchecker.c' source code, where `Flag-Checker 9000` takes user input, hashes it using MD5, and compares it to a macro called 'FLAG_HASH'.
Investigate the '.github/workflows/build_flag_checker.yml' file, which is responsible for packaging `Flag-Checker 9000`.
Analyze the 'build.sh' and 'flaghash.sh' scripts, revealing that 'FLAG_AUTH' is used as a cookie for a cURL request but isn't accessible in any file.
Check the commit history, finding a commit titled 'Fix auth!!!'.
Review the changes in the commit, discovering that the 'auth' cookie was previously set in 'gethash.sh'.
Run a cURL command with the discovered auth cookie to access the IP address and obtain the flag.
