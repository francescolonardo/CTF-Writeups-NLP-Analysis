Exploit
When you google the challenge description, you find out that the quote is from Mr. Robot. This indicates that the user might want to check out the robots.txt for the website.

When you open the website, it serves the index.html file, which has content written about Brobot, again trying to put across robots.txt. When you visit robots.txt, you see:
```
Hey there, you're not a robot, yet I see you sniffing through this file.
SEO you later!
Now get off my lawn.
Disallow: /fade/to/black
```
When you visit the disallowed route, you get the flag!

The flag is:

csictf{br0b0t_1s_pr3tty_c00l_1_th1nk}
