Title: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in a Web Application

During a CTF competition, I encountered a web application that included a search feature allowing users to search for information on the server. Given the potential security risks associated with Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities, I suspected that the application might be vulnerable to XSS attacks.

To test for XSS vulnerabilities, I entered a payload containing a script tag, such as <script>alert('XSS')</script>, into the search field. Upon submitting the form, the application accepted the payload and displayed the results, indicating that the application was vulnerable to XSS attacks.

To demonstrate the potential risks associated with XSS, I crafted a payload that would allow me to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the victim's browser. This payload included a script that would steal the user's cookies and send them to an attacker-controlled server.

This payload allowed me to steal the user's cookies and demonstrate the potential risks associated with XSS attacks.

This CTF writeup highlights the importance of properly securing web applications against XSS vulnerabilities by implementing proper input validation and output encoding controls, using Content Security Policy (CSP), and validating user input. By exploiting the vulnerability, I was able to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the victim's browser, steal the user's cookies, demonstrate the potential risks associated with XSS attacks, and recommend proper countermeasures to prevent these types of attacks.
