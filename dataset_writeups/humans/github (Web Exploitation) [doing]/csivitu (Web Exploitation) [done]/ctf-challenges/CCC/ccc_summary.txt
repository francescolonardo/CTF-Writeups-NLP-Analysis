Examine the website source to find routes `/login` and `/adminNames`.
Fill out the login form and inspect the Network Tab in your browser to find the token header containing a JWT.
Decode the JWT to find the payload, then apply the `rot13` cipher to the `admin` value.
Visit the `/adminNames` route to download a file containing a GitHub URL, and find the list of admin usernames in the repository.
Modify the JWT payload with a rot13 encrypted admin username and change the admin value to the rot13 encrypted string for `true`.
Find the JWT secret by trying the `/getFile?file=../.env` route to download the `.env` file.
Send a GET request to the `/admin` route with the JWT in the Authorization header.
rot13 decrypt the received flag to get the real flag.
