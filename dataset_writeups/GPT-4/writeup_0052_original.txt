Title: "Blind Injection"

The target of this challenge is a web application that allows users to search for books in a database. The search feature takes user input and queries the database using SQL. The goal of this challenge is to perform a blind SQL injection attack to retrieve sensitive information from the database.

The first step is to identify the search parameter in the application. After some testing, it is discovered that the search parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. However, the application does not return any error messages, so a blind SQL injection attack must be performed.

To perform the attack, the hacker creates a script that sends specially crafted SQL queries to the application and monitors the response time. If the query returns true, the response time is longer than if the query returns false. The hacker uses this difference in response time to infer whether the query was successful or not.

With this technique, the hacker is able to extract sensitive information from the database, including usernames and passwords. The hacker can then use this information to log in to the application and gain access to additional resources.

The vulnerability in this application could have been prevented by using parameterized queries or by properly validating user input. It is important for developers to follow secure coding practices to prevent these types of attacks.
