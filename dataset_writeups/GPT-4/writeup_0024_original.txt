Title: SSRF Exploitation to Access Internal Services and Retrieve Sensitive Data

During a CTF competition, I came across a web application that allowed users to input URLs to fetch content from external websites. This functionality piqued my interest, as it might be vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks, which could potentially allow me to access internal services and retrieve sensitive data.

To test for SSRF vulnerability, I crafted a URL that pointed to an internal IP address (e.g., http://127.0.0.1) to see if the application would fetch the content from that address. When the application successfully fetched the content, it confirmed the presence of an SSRF vulnerability.

To exploit the SSRF vulnerability, I explored the internal network further by scanning for open ports and identifying potentially sensitive services. I discovered an internal service running on a non-standard port that seemed to store sensitive information, including the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge.

By crafting a URL that pointed to the internal service, I was able to fetch the sensitive information, including the flag, using the SSRF vulnerability.

This CTF writeup emphasizes the importance of properly validating and sanitizing user-supplied URLs in web applications to prevent SSRF vulnerabilities. By exploiting the SSRF vulnerability, I was able to access internal services and retrieve sensitive data, including the flag needed to complete the challenge.
