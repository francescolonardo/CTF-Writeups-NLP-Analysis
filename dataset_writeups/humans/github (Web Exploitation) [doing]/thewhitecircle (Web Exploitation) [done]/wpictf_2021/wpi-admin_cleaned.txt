* email of our friend : alexo@uupeye.edu
* “students” here have some “bad” passwords
* emails of students are visible on : https://wpiadmin.wpictf.xyz/topStudents
* so we get a list of emails which we can bruteforce on student login!

* after bruteforcing we get all these credentials

* after checking each profile we get flag on `dennisb@uupeye.edu`
