* Robots reveal an `admin` page and `.git` directory

* I used a very useful tool which helps to dump file contents of websites which use GIT version control system
* https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools

* `.git` directory dumped :

* now we can use extractor to get files from the dump

* I found 2 `users.db` files, both are sqlite3 databases
* one contains `bcrypt` hashes and other one contains `md5` hashes
* I cracked md5 hashes first because they take less time

* one valid credential found :

* login on `admin.html` and we get the flag
