    "Given a simple Web server written in Python, handling only GET and POST requests with files",
    "Developed a suspicion of a directory traversal vulnerability either in the GET path handling or the POST filename",
    "Added debug prints to the file for the GET path and POST filename to confirm the suspected vulnerability",
    "Confirmed that there was a directory traversal vulnerability in the POST filename",
    "Used the discovered vulnerability to write a request to the root directory with the filename 'lol.txt' and the content 'HACKED'",
    "Looked for files that could be overwritten, but couldn't modify anything in '/home/manhndd/.ssh/' due to a lack of appropriate permission",
    "Decided to overwrite '.bashrc' file, which would execute when the user 'manhndd' SSH-es into the server",
    "Race with other players in the game to overwrite '.bashrc' file with their payload",
    "Due to the absence of 'nc' and any way to exfiltrate the flag, read the flag from '/var/secret' and write it to '/opt/mydank', wherein '/opt' is the web facing directory",
    "Spammed 'Go' on Burp's repeater to send the request and concurrently wrote a Python script to read from '/mydank'",
    "Finally, managed to win the race and acquire the flag"
