#context
First thing we notice when we open the homepage is register and login pages, but they doesn't seem to be vulnerable to SQL injection. So we create a user and we login.

#discovery
Let's see that create todo page, if we try to inject a simple ' in the todo we get an internal server error, so we know that probably we can inject SQL. In fact, if we try a simple a' OR '1'='1, the query is executed, and in the todo list, we can see the output 1.

#exploitation
If we play a little with queries, we will find that a good method to inject a query is this a' || (some_query) || 'b.

#discovery
Now we have to find some info about the DBMS. In order to do that, we have to understand which DBMS is being used. We try to select information_schema, which is MySQL, but it won't work. If we try sqlite_master, it will work, so we print some information, and then we can start printing the good stuff.

#exploitation
The challenge description clearly says us to find our secret. So if we print the secret "column" of every user selected by his id, we are gonna find ours and with it our flag.
