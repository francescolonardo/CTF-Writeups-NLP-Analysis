Log in with junk values and check cookies for the `token` key.
Use jwt.io to analyze the token and find out it uses the RS256 algorithm.
Access `/robots.txt` and find a public key.
Identify the JWT key confusion attack, which involves changing from an asymmetric cipher algorithm to a symmetric cipher algorithm.
Create an HMAC(HS256) token using the public key as the secret with the Node.js `jsonwebtoken` library.
Access the `/flag` route using the newly created token as a cookie to obtain the flag.
Recognize the challenge's bug: JWT encoding only used RS256, while verification used both RS256 and HS256 algorithms.
