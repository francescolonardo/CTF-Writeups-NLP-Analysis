The website appears to be a renderer for LaTeX code. Writing LaTex and clicking "Generate PDF" gives a link to a rendered PDf. The output LOG of the LaTeX renderer will also be displayed. 

1. Looking at the source HTML indicates that we need to read the flag from a file found in `/sweatin/to/the/oldies/flag.txt`.

2. LaTeX is turing-complete and has the ability to read files, however, certain strings have been blacklisted. Most notably, `/` has been blacklisted making it challenging to create the path to read the file.

3. The `/` character however can be isolated from `index.html` using the `\StrMid` function from the `xstring` package. By getting the `/` character from `index.html`, we can use it to build our path and bypass the blacklisted characters filter.

4. Using this we can write the following LaTeX code that will build the path and read the flag:
[LaTeX code: Uses xstring package to bypass blacklisted characters, build the path to the flag, and read it]

The flag can be found in the returned LOG data.
