The challenge provides the following hint: "Normal fries are nice, but everything's better with a curl in it. I'm with you, every step of the way."

Upon opening the link, an image is displayed. To solve the challenge, a series of curl commands were executed with various headers, cookies, and JSON data. Here's the process:

Change the method to POST and send a request to the URL.

Set the Referer header to Google and send a request to the URL. In response, you receive a hint to attend a dinner party hosted by dscvit.

Set the Host header to dscvit.com and send a request to the URL. The response mentions potatoes, carrots, milk, and cookies.

Set the user cookie to "root" and send a request to the URL, as potatoes and carrots are root vegetables. The response contains a JSON-related hint.

Set the Content-Type header to application/json, include JSON data, and send a request to the URL. The response points out that "messi" is required in the JSON data.

Add "messi" to the JSON data and send a request to the URL. The response asks for the club Messi is in.
Change the "messi" value to "psg" and send a request to the URL, since Messi is playing for PSG at the time.

After executing the final command, the flag is returned.
