#context
This is a kind of very unique challenge. No vulnerability, no bug, just a clean blog site. Instead of a complete CTF challenge, this is a test of web development knowledge.

#discovery
If you read the text carefully, "you may find a good application for your memory." That is a hint for the challenge. When the dev talked about memory, it must be something to do with the storage.

#exploitation
Question is, how do we access the storage? It is simple, for Firefox browser, open the Developer Tools and go to storage.

#discovery
I find the flag in the storage.
