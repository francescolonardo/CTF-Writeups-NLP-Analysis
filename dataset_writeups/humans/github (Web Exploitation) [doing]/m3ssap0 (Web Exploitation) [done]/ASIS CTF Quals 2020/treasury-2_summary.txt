Consider the XML-related error and the hint about a `/flag` file to understand the potential for a XXE attack.

Craft a malicious payload and pass it via the SQL injection vulnerability using a `UNION` operation.

Test the exploit with a payload designed for an XXE Injection attack, attempting to retrieve a sensitive file (e.g., /etc/passwd).

Confirm the success of the attack by observing the contents of the targeted file.

Use PHP filters to read the source code via base64 encoding, preparing another payload for the XXE attack.

Execute the XXE attack using the URL-encoded payload and obtain the encoded flag from the vulnerable web application.

Decode the base64 encoded result to obtain the flag.
