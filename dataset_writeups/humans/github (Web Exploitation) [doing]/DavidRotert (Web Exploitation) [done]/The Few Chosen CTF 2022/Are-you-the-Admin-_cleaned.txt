The app is a page with a form which says "Create user". After entering a name and clicking on "Ctrate", it lists the created users with name and if they are admins.

The source code for the app is avaliable as a download for the challenge.

## Review
The app is a Node.js TypeScript app written with Next JS. The `auth.ts` file is the most interesting part. The code snippet shows that it simply stores the request body object into the database, as seen in the requests made to the API endpoint with the format `{"username":"our-username"}`.

It just seems to store the body object into the database which is also seen in the requests made to API endpoint: `{"username":"our-username"}`.

The shema file `shema.prism` shows, that there is a field `isAdmin` field in the `User` model, which is set to `false` by default.

By sending a custom request body where `isAdmin` is set to `true` we can reveal the flag.
