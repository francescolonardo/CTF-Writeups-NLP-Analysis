Analyze the JavaScript code of the Express app and understand the restrictions on the `file` parameter.
Inspect the `a.cpp` file and notice the `system("cat flag.txt")` command, indicating the presence of `flag.txt` in the same directory.
Craft a payload to bypass the restrictions and use `path.resolve()` to access `flag.txt`. Payload: `/getFile?file[]=a&file[]=b&file[]=c&file[]=d&file[]=/../flag.txt&file[]=.&file[]=js`
Send the payload to retrieve the flag.
