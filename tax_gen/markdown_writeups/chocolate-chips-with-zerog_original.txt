<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Hello W-Team,</p>

<p>Recon has found an old website from OmniFlags. We think there may be an insecure admin portal somewhere. See if there is anything you can find! They never did hire the best developers.</p>

<p>Report back, \
HQ</p>

<h2>Hints</h2>

<ol>
<li>Beep Boop, now where did we put that page again?</li>
<li>Cookies are stored locally, like in a cookie jar or something...</li>
</ol>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<ol>
<li>The admin.html page needs to be found. There is an invisible link in the nav-bar. Robots.txt mentions /admin.html, or it can be seen when inspecting the code.</li>
<li>Once the admin login page is found, then you need to attempt to login. At this point a cookie is generated.</li>
<li>By checking the cookie, we can see that we have an admin cookie set to false. If the value is changed to 'true' the page will redirect to the flag.</li>
</ol>
