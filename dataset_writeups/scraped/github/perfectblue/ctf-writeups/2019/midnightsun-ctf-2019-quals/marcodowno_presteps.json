    "Identify that the challenge is a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) challenge which involves exploiting a page to pop up an alert.",
    "Analyze the source code of the webpage, noticing it is a 'Markdown' converter that uses regex.",
    "Recognize that all open HTML tags '<' have been removed, making a traditional XSS attack impossible.",
    "Identify a specific replace function that changes markdown format images into HTML image tags, but does not sanitize the 'alt' parameter.",
    "Decide to exploit the unsanitized 'alt' parameter by injecting a double quote to break out of the alt tag, followed by a JavaScript event handler for the XSS.",
    "Create and test the final URL 'http://marcodowno-01.play.midnightsunctf.se:3001/markdown?input=[\" onerror=\"alert(1)\"](http://x)' to trigger the XSS alert attack."
