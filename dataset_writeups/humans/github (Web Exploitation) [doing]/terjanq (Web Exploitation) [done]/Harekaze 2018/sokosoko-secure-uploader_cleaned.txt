By a quick look at the [decrypt.php], I noticed a possibility of the `SQL Injection` inside `UUID POST data`.

So, we are forced to make an injection in `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` format.  
We would like to use the given information about UUID needed to decrypt the image, so our query should look like `SELECT id LIKE '9e5a%'`.  
Comes out that we can do it by the following input: `'OR id/*-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-*/LIKE'9e5a%`, which after uploading in tandem with the [flag.png.encrypted] returns an image with the flag inside.
