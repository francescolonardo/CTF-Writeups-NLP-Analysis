Title: File Inclusion Vulnerability in a Web Application

During a CTF competition, I encountered a web application that included a file upload feature allowing users to upload images to the server. Given the potential security risks associated with File Inclusion vulnerabilities, I suspected that the application might be vulnerable to this type of attack.

To test for File Inclusion vulnerabilities, I uploaded a malicious PHP file named "shell.php" that would allow me to execute arbitrary code on the server. To trigger the vulnerability, I navigated to the uploaded file's URL and appended "?file=shell.php" to the URL.

Upon doing so, the application included the "shell.php" file in the server-side code and executed the code contained within it, allowing me to execute arbitrary code on the server.

To demonstrate the potential risks associated with File Inclusion vulnerabilities, I crafted a payload that would allow me to steal sensitive data from the server. This payload included a request to the server with a crafted parameter that would allow me to access a sensitive file containing confidential data.

This payload allowed me to access the sensitive file and demonstrate the potential risks associated with File Inclusion attacks.

This CTF writeup highlights the importance of properly securing web applications against File Inclusion vulnerabilities by implementing proper input validation controls, using safe file upload handling techniques, and validating user input. By exploiting the vulnerability, I was able to execute arbitrary code on the server, access sensitive data, demonstrate the potential risks associated with File Inclusion attacks, and recommend proper countermeasures to prevent these types of attacks.
