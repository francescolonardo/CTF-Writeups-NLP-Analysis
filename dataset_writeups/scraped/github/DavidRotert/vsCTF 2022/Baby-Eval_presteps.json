    "Observed that Baby Eval is a Node app with a path / that lists information including server source code",
    "Analyzed the source codes provided and determined that the webpage is created by either executing an eval from a payload query parameter or calling the directory() function with specific parameters",
    "Understood that the goal of the CTF challenge is to fetch the environment variable 'flag'",
    "Realized that 'eval' can be triggered by entering a payload as the GET query parameter",
    "Discovered that the code uses a blacklist Regex to prevent the execution of certain strings or functions",
    "Observing that parentheses and some keywords were blocked, searched a way to call a function without parentheses",
    "Found a JavaScript feature called Template Literals that can be used to call functions without parentheses",
    "Wrote a payload using this Template Literal method to directly call the directory function with 'flag' as its parameter",
    "Appended this payload '?payload=directory`flag`' to the URL of the webpage",
    "Concluded that the directory function then receives an array with a single string 'flag' as an argument, which by the function's design returns the value of the 'flag' environment variable"
