<p>First thing, check the cells and find a formula. </p>

<p>Formula seems to be pointing to another sheet's called Source and its range 'A:B'. </p>

<p>When you use spreadsheets, the accessibility tools actually help in un hiding hidden sheets, like the Source sheet here. </p>

<p>To activate accessibility tools, go to Tools ('Outils' on the picture), and select Accessibility tools. </p>

<p>Accessibility Tool include a way to call a range from the document so Monkey see🐒, Monkey do 🐒:</p>

<p><strong>Note: it turns out you can reach a hidden sheet's full range by just typing its name ('Source' instead of 'Source'!A:B)</strong></p>

<p>It reveals the hidden sheet! On the bottom left you can see it got added to the panes. </p>

<p>And as suspected, you can find the flag in there somewhere. Thanks to my team mates for finding the flag for me</p>
