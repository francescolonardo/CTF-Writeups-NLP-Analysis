Problem description:
Someone told me to use a lib, but real developers rock regex one-liners.

So it's XSS challenge and we basically have to XSS a page and send them a URL popping alert(1) to get the flag
Here is the source of the webpage. It's apparently a "Markdown" converter which uses regex
```html

Preview:

In the first replace, it removes all the open (<) HTML tags. How do we XSS without open tags? 
The replace that caught my eye was

replace(/!\[([^\]]+)\]\((https?:\/\/[a-zA-Z0-9./?#]+)\)/g, '<img src="$2" alt="$1"/>')

It woulb be used to transform the image tags in Markdown such as ![img1](http://url) into <img src="http://url" alt="img1">. The URL is decently sanitized but alt is not. We can inject a double quote and break out of the alt tag, inject a event handler which would then pop up an XSS. 
Here was the final URL
