    "Visited the website",
    "Identified that the website simulates a TODO list application",
    "Understood that TODO notes of users can be read by enumerating URLs in a certain format",
    "Assumed that one of these notes contains the CTF flag",
    "Wrote a Python script to automate the URL enumeration and flag discovery",
    "The script loops through a range of integers, replacing each into a URL and calling the web page",
    "If the page content contains 'MCA{' (indicating the presence of a flag), the content is printed and the loop breaks",
    "Any HTTP error during the page request is printed",
    "In between each iteration, the script pauses for a random interval between 1 to 4 seconds",
    "Ran the script and obtained the flag 'MCA{al3x4_5et_a_r3minder}'"
