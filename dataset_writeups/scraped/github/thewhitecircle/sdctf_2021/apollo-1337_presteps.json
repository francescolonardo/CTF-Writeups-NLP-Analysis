    "Visited the URL: https://space.sdc.tf/",
    "Viewed the page source",
    "Identified unique JavaScript with nextExport, autoExport and buildId attributes",
    "Performed GET request to host https://space.sdc.tf with the endpoint /api/status",
    "Received a response indicating a healthy status and version",
    "Noticed three endpoints (/status, /rocketLaunch, /fuel) in the response",
    "Requested the /fuel endpoint, received a list of pumps and their IDs",
    "Attempted a simple GET request to /rocketLaunch, received a notice that the request body must be JSON",
    "Leveraged the assumption that a POST request might be needed and that the word 'launch' could be a keyword",
    "Sent a POST request with 'launch' attribute set to true",
    "Upon receiving a missing rocket name error, a random rocket name was added to the POST request body",
    "Received an error indicating 'triton' as an available rocket name",
    "Assigned 'triton' as the rocket name in the POST request body",
    "Then received an error for missing launch time, added a random timestamp to the POST request body to understand the format",
    "Once the correct timestamp format was identified, the timestamp was updated in the POST request",
    "The error message then indicated pumpId was missing, added a random pump ID from earlier /fuel endpoint response",
    "The error message then indicated a missing token, scoured the page source and Javascript files to locate the token",
    "Incorporated the token identified in the Javascript files into the POST request",
    "Finally, successful completion of POST request was achieved with all required parameters, capturing the flag"
