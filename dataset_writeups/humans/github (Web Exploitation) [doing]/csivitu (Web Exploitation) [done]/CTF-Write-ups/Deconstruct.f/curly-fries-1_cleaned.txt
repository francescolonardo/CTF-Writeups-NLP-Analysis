The challenge gives us the following text:
"Normal fries are nice, but everything's better with a curl in it. The flag is right in front of you."

Upon opening the link, an image is displayed, which hints at Sweden. So, the solution involves setting the language headers to Swedish using a "curl" command.
[Shell command: Set Accept-Language header to Swedish]

Executing this command returns the flag.
