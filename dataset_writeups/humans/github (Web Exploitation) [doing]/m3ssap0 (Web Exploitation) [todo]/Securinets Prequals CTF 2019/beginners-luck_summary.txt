Understand that the token must be generated from one IP address, and then the IP address must be changed to discover the previously generated token.
Write a Python script to discover the token.
Enter the discovered token in the form on the website, ensuring the IP address used is the one for which the token was generated.
Obtain the flag from the resulting page.
