Observe that the `index.php` code checks that the `hash` parameter does not equal `10932435112`, and the sha1 hash of `hash` equals that of `10932435112`.
Notice that `$hash` and `$target` are compared using `==`, which is vulnerable to type juggling.
Find a hash starting with `0e` that matches the sha1 hash of `10932435112` using `==`.
Pass one of these matching values with the GET parameter `hash` to obtain the flag.
