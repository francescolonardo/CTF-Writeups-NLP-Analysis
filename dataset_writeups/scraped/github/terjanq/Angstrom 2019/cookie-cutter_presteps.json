    "Recognize that the challenge focuses on hacking the JWT cookie",
    "Understand that to obtain the flag, the secretid must match the length of the secrets array and the permissions must be set to 'admin'",
    "Identify that the server adds a new secret to the secrets array every time a cookie is signed",
    "Note that the server does not perform security checks on the alg or secretid fields in the JWT",
    "Create a JWT with the permissions set to 'admin' and the secretid set to a string that does not exist in the secrets array",
    "Encode the JWT by setting the algorithm to 'none'",
    "Send the malicious JWT to the server",
    "Note that the server will retrieve a value of 'undefined' for secret['randomstr'] and will not attempt to verify the JWT because the algorithm is 'none'",
    "Observe that this allows the server to pass the security checks and flag the token as true"
