Title: Uncovering Hidden Parameters to Reveal Admin Interface

During a CTF competition, I stumbled upon a web application that had a login form, but no visible link to an admin interface. This piqued my interest, as there might be a hidden parameter that could grant access to the admin interface, potentially leading to the discovery of the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge.

To uncover hidden parameters, I used a proxy tool like Burp Suite to intercept and analyze the login request. I noticed that the request contained a parameter named isAdmin with a value of false. This parameter wasn't visible in the login form, which suggested that it might be a hidden parameter used to control access to the admin interface.

To test if the hidden isAdmin parameter could grant access to the admin interface, I modified its value to true in the intercepted request and forwarded it to the server. Upon submitting the modified request, the web application granted access to the admin interface, confirming that the hidden parameter could be exploited to gain unauthorized access.

Inside the admin interface, I discovered a page that contained the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge. By exploiting the hidden isAdmin parameter, I was able to gain unauthorized access to the admin interface and obtain the flag needed to complete the challenge.

This CTF writeup emphasizes the importance of securing hidden parameters and implementing proper access control mechanisms in web applications to prevent unauthorized access. By uncovering and exploiting the hidden parameter, I gained access to the admin interface and obtained the flag needed to complete the challenge.
