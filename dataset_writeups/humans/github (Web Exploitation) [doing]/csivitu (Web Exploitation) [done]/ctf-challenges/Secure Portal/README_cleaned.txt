Description: "This is a super secure portal with a really unusual HTML file. Try to login."

You need to view the page source.

On seeing it, you will realize that this script has been obsfucated, and is checking for the password for this portal. The list `var _0x575c` has been encoded to hex, which translates to this.
`var _0x575c = ["2-4", "substring", "4-7", "getItem", "deleteItem", "12-14", "0-2", "setItem", "9-12", "^7M", "updateItem", "bb=", "7-9", "14-16", "localStorage"];`

Now, in the function `CheckPassword`, you see the word `window` being repeated many times. For an example, the line `window[_0x4bbdc3[0x0]][_0x4bbdc3[0x2]]` is actually `window.localStorage.setItem` and so on. The password has been split to many parts. This command stores each part of the password to an assigned key.
Similarly, the line `window[_0x4bbdc3[0x0]][_0x4bbdc3[0x1]]` is `window.localStorage.getItem`. We use this command to check the splitted password with our input password. The password is `5W$Fbb=+nBE*pg4t^7M`.
