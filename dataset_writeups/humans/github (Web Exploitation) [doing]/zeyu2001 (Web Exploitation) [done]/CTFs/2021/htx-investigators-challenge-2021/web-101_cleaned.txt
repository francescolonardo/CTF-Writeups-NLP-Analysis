There is a blacklist filter for `#` and `=`. Using `test' or 1-- -` gives us account credentials, but logging in with these does not give us the flag.

We could use a `UNION` based injection to dump the database and get the flag.

`username=test' or 1 UNION SELECT *, null from flag-- -&password=test' or 1 UNION SELECT *, null from flag-- -`

### Find the Malicious Attacks by Revo Force

We were given CSV files containing network traffic data, as well as a shapefile containing cameras in Singapore. We are tasked to find where most of the attacks are originating from, and the number of cameras within a 1.3km radius.

First, we obtain the most common `src_ip`, and find its corresponding latitude and longitude.

After, we can parse the shapefile using geopandas, and use the [haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine\_formula) to determine the  great-circle distance between each camera and the `src_ip` location based on the latitude and longitudes.
