Title: AudioEdit
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: SQL Injection
Tools used: easyTAG
Keywords: mp3 metadata

#context
The challenge description said "I made this cool site for editing audio files. Can you exploit it?". After visiting the site, I got a simple page with written "AudioEdit" with the chance of upload a .mp3 audio file.

#discovery
The provided file will be uploaded and the discovered insertion statement in the db looks like this: `INSERT INTO audioedit (..., foo, bla, ...) VALUES (..., 'author','title'...);`.

#exploitation
In order to do an SQL-injection we have to create a special author and title field. I used easyTAG but of course you can use the tool of your choice to modify mp3 metadata. In order to inject and maintain a valid INSERT statement you can create a mp3 with the following metadata: `title  = "" (not important) author = a', (SELECT @@version))-- -b`, which creates the following statement. This gave us the database version.

#discovery
Next we wanted to know the tables name. And of course the columns names.

#exploitation
Finally we get the flag.

#code
```
INSERT INTO audioedit (..., foo, bla, ...) VALUES (..., 'a', (SELECT @@version))-- -b',''...);
```
