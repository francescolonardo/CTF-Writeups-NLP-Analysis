Title: "XML External Entity (XXE) Injection"

During a CTF competition, I found a vulnerability in a web application that allowed me to perform XML External Entity (XXE) injection. This type of vulnerability occurs when an application fails to validate or sanitize user input when processing XML data.

To exploit the vulnerability, I crafted a malicious XML file containing an external entity reference that pointed to a file on my local system. When the web application processed the XML data, it included the content of the external file in the application's response, potentially disclosing sensitive information.

This type of attack can be used to read files, execute commands, or launch Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.

To mitigate this vulnerability, I recommended that the application implement proper input validation and sanitization when processing XML data. Additionally, restricting the access to sensitive files on the server can prevent attackers from reading them.

This CTF writeup highlights the importance of properly securing web applications against XML External Entity (XXE) injection attacks by implementing proper input validation and sanitization. By exploiting the vulnerability, I was able to demonstrate the potential risks associated with XXE injection attacks and recommend proper countermeasures to prevent these types of attacks.
