Examine the PHP code snippet on the page that checks password input against three conditions before revealing a secret flag.

Determine that the first "if" statement is not relevant for the analysis.

Bypass the second "if" statement by using the same value for the `pass` URL parameter and the User-Agent header, exploiting PHP's `==` type conversion confusion.

Recognize that the third "if" statement contains the secret flag within an MD5 calculation, and the comparison only considers the first character of two strings.

Understand that the value of `$_[0]` can only be a single hex character from `0` to `f`.

Test single hex characters from `0` to `f` for both the `pass` input and the User-Agent header.

Discover that using the character `b` for both the `pass` input and the User-Agent header returns the flag.
