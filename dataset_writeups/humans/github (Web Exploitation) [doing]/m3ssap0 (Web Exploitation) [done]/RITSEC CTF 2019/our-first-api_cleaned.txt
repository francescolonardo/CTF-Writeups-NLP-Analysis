Connecting to the website will give the following message: "This page is only for authentication with our api, located at port 4000!"


Connecting to port 4000 will give some hint. 
At this point you have references to an exposed API. Trying to connect to '/normal' endpoint will result in an error 'JWS missing'.

So you can request with a HTTP GET a JWT using the `/auth` API and specifying a `name`.

You can decode the token to understand its format.

From it you can see that you have low privileges (i.e. `user`), but you can use this token to be authenticated performing a HTTP GET.

The authentication works, but the correct endpoint to call is `/admin`.

Unfortunately, you don't have enough privileges. Furthermore, trying to alter the JWT changing the `alg` to `none`, changing the `type` to `admin` and removing the signature will not work.

Analyzing the HTML source of the API documentation page, you can discover an interesting comment: 'Robots can help you with the api'.

So you can discover: /robots.txt

And you can get the signing certificate signing.pem that can be used to craft a malicious JWT.

Now the right API endpoint can be called to get the flag.
