Title: JavaScript Obfuscation and Reverse Engineering to Uncover a Hidden Flag

In a CTF challenge, I stumbled upon a web application that featured an interactive puzzle. After completing the puzzle, a message indicated that the flag was hidden within the application's JavaScript code. My goal was to reverse engineer the obfuscated JavaScript code to uncover the hidden flag.

I began by inspecting the source code of the web page and locating the relevant JavaScript file. The code was heavily obfuscated, making it difficult to understand the logic and identify where the flag might be concealed.

To reverse engineer the obfuscated code, I used a combination of online tools and manual analysis. First, I used a JavaScript beautifier to reformat the code, making it more readable. Next, I analyzed the code's structure and identified key functions and variables that could potentially hold the flag.

Through careful analysis, I discovered a function that seemed to perform a series of transformations on a string of characters. I suspected that this function was responsible for decrypting the flag. I executed the function in the browser's developer console and provided the necessary input to reveal the decrypted flag.

This CTF writeup highlights the importance of understanding code obfuscation and reverse engineering techniques when attempting to uncover hidden information within a web application. By reverse engineering the obfuscated JavaScript code, I was able to decrypt the hidden flag and complete the challenge.
