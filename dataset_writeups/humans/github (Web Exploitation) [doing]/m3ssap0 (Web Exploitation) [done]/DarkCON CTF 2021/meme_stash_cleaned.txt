A basic enumeration will reveal the presence of a Git repository.

So you can use git-dumper to dump all the repository.

With `git log` you can discover a commit with a suspect message. 

Probably the flag was present before that commit and has been removed. For this reason you can compare commits using 'git diff'.

The previous commit contained the flag. You can restore that file checking out the commit and get the flag.
