<p>I logged in using the given credentials.</p>

<p>Found a cookie named userData with userID and username</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HZzaAdD.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>here userID is <code>972</code> and username is <code>kupatergent</code></p>

<p>Now i started looking into the given server code files and in one of the files named app.js
i found this:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SuX3MTK.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>that indicates that we don’t need password for admin access we just need the correct user id.</p>

<p>So, now i fired up BurpSuite sent the request with cookie to the intruder replaced the username with admin and set the payload parameter at userID</p>

<p><code>
Cookie: userData=j%3A%7B%22userID%22%3A%22§9§%22%2C%22username%22%3A%22admin%22%7D
</code>

<p>Payload settings:</p>

<p>Also set up a grep match for flag{ as that is the starting of the flag</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5VF3VGA.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>And now we have to look for a ticked checkbox for flag{ and in the response section of that response we have the flag</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4K3oZKR.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>here we have the flag, we can confirm it on the website by changing the cookie values:</p>

<p><code>
userID = 768
username = admin
</code></p>

<p><code>
flag{y4m_y4m_c00k13s}
</code></p>
