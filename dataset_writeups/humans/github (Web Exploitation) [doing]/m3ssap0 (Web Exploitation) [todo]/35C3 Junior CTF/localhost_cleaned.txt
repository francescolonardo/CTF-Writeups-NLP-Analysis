Analyzing `http://35.207.189.79/pyserver/server.py` two interesting methods can be discovered.

The header is set in the following method.

[Python function to add security headers to HTTP responses with special handling for localhost requests]

The functionality that can be abused to generate a request from the same server is the following.

[Flask route to proxy and serve images, with basic validation checks]

This is the functionality used by the `loadImage` method in the programming environment.

The server runs at what defined here:

[Python script: starts a web application and listens for incoming HTTP requests on all available network interfaces at port 8075.]

An image is mandatory to abuse the service, because the Content-Type is strictly checked, but three extensions are blacklisted in the code that sets the target header.

Hence, the following image can be used: `img/paperbots.svg`.

The exploit is performed with a GET request like the following (or using `0.0.0.0` for the IP address).

[HTTP GET request to fetch an image from a remote server via a proxy endpoint]
    
The response will contain the flag.
