#context
This website has a button you can press that will give you the flag. However, if you press it in your web browser, it will give you an error saying "You're not picobrowser!" and list some text after it that depends on your OS and browser.

#discovery
For me, it says: "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:70.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/70.0, but yours will likely be different)". That string of text is known as an User-Agent and it tells the server what browser you're using.

#exploitation
To convince them that you're running a "picobrowser", you can just change your User-Agent HTTP header To do this, I chose to use cURL because it easily allows you to control the headers.
