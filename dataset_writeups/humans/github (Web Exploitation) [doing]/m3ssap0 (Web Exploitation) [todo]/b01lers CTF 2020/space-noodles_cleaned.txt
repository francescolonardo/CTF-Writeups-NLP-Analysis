This was a guessing challenge and I didn't like it very much.

Trying to connect to the homepage will give you an error of HTTP method not allowed.

If you try a wrong HTTP verb, the server will return all the allowed methods.

Trying each method, you can discover that some of them, i.e. `POST` and `PUT`, will return a different result.

At this point you have to guess that some endpoints are present.

For each endpoint, you have to try all HTTP verbs in order to discover the correct one to use.

At this point, you have to guess that an `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` parameter must be used to perform the search operation

Using the `flag` value will give you another part of the flag.

Passing a random value will let you to discover that a *vim* command must be used.

Considering that the name of the parameter is `exit`, you have to discover that `:wq` is the correct value to use.

Putting everything together will give you the following.

At this point you can easily guess the first part of the flag (referred to the PDF).
