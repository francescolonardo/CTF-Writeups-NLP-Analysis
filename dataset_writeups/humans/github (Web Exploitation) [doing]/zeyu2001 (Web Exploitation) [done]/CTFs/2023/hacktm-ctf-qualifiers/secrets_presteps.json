    "Notice the difference in redirect URLs when a note is found or not found",
    "Consider the potential of exploiting the system by bloating the URL length (via the 'ids' parameter) to hit a limitation",
    "Explore the possibility of detecting a client-side error when exceeding Chrome's maximum URL length (2MB)",
    "Experiment with creating a URL that just hits the length limit and observe a redirection to an 'about:blank#blocked' page when the limit is exceeded",
    "Notice that if the URL limit is hit, the origin of the page remains that of the parent window",
    "Test the observation by creating a URL for a successful and unsuccessful query respectively and compare the resulting origins of the pages",
    "Derive a proof-of-concept (PoC) to brute-force a character of the flag by exploiting the observed behavior",
    "Leverage a backend server to eliminate unsuccessful queries and zero in on the correct flag",
    "Consider the downside of the above PoC - the potential strain on the server due to very long URLs",
    "Explore the alternative of exploiting Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy violation as a faster and more efficient method",
    "Create a policy that only allows form submissions to a specific domain, so queries leading to a different domain will be blocked",
    "Observe that the violation can be detected through a 'securitypolicyviolation' event listener"
