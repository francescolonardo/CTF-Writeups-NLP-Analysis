Title: AudioEdit

The main idea of finding the flag is recognizing a pattern to pwn.

After I visited /audioedit/, I got a page with written "AudioEdit".

It can be requested with an identifier delivered as the HTTP-GET parameter 'file'.

We figured the insertion statement looked something like this:
```
INSERT INTO audioedit (..., foo, bla, ...) VALUES (..., 'author','title'...);
```

In order to do an SQL-injection we have to create a special author and title field. I used easyTAG but of course you can use the tool of your choice to modify mp3-meta-data. In order to inject and maintain a valid INSERTION statement you can create a mp3 with the following meta data:
```
title  = "" (leer)
author = a', (SELECT @@version))-- -b
```

which creates the following statement
```
INSERT INTO audioedit (..., foo, bla, ...) VALUES (..., 'a', (SELECT @@version))-- -b',''...);
```
This gave us the database version.

Next we wanted to know the database name.
And of course the column names.
Finally we get the flag.
