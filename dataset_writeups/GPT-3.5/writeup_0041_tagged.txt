Title: XSS Attack on a Web Application
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: Cross-Site Scripting
Tools used: None
Keywords: XSS, vulnerability, input validation, sanitation, output encoding, session cookies, sensitive information, user credentials, payment information

#overview
During a CTF competition, I discovered a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in a web application. The application allowed users to submit feedback through a form, which was then displayed on the website. However, the application did not properly sanitize the user input, allowing me to inject malicious JavaScript code into the feedback field.

#attack_execution
To exploit the vulnerability, I crafted a malicious script that would steal the user's session cookies when they visited the website. When a user accessed the page with my injected code, their session cookies were sent to my own server, giving me access to their account.

#analysis
Using this XSS attack, I was able to access sensitive information, such as user credentials and payment information. This vulnerability could have had serious consequences for the users and the website.

To mitigate this vulnerability, I recommended that the application implement proper input validation and sanitation techniques to prevent XSS attacks. The application should also implement proper output encoding techniques to prevent injection of malicious code.

This CTF writeup highlights the importance of properly securing web applications by implementing proper input validation and sanitation techniques to prevent XSS attacks. By exploiting the vulnerability, I was able to demonstrate the potential risks associated with an XSS vulnerability and recommend proper countermeasures to prevent these types of attacks.
