# Title: Hunt

In this challenge, you see a bunch of captcha's floating around on your screen, and the goal is to successfully get 5 captchas. There's many ways to solve this, here's what I did:

When you see the source, this is the function which creates the captchas and makes them move:
[Javascript code creating and moving captchas]

Just modify this function using your Browser Devtools, remove the part where it runs loop.
[Modified Javascript code]

Now, you can manually add 5 captchas and get them. Just call the function `addCaptcha()` and keep clicking the boxes. When you're done with 5, click on `GET FLAG`, and copy the flag from the screen!
