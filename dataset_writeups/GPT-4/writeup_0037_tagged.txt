Title: Exploiting Insecure Direct Object References to Access Restricted Files
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: Insecure Direct Object Reference
Tools used: None
Keywords: IDOR, access controls, authorization checks, CTF

#overview
The writeup describes how the author exploited an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in a web application during a CTF competition. The application allowed users to download files by providing a file identifier as a URL parameter, which the author manipulated to include other file identifiers, including those that they should not have access to.

#analysis
The author confirmed the presence of an IDOR vulnerability when the web application allowed them to download restricted files. They then exploited the vulnerability to retrieve the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge by enumerating various file identifiers, attempting to find the one associated with the flag file. The author was successful in obtaining the flag needed to complete the challenge.

#attack_execution
The writeup highlights the importance of implementing proper access controls and authorization checks in web applications to prevent IDOR vulnerabilities. By exploiting the IDOR vulnerability, the author was able to access restricted files and obtain the flag needed to complete the challenge.
