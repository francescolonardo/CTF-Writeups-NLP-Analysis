The challenge gives us the following text:
"Normal fries are nice, but everything's better with a curl in it. Why do logos make things so recognizable?"

Upon opening the link, an image is displayed that shows the logos of Xbox and Linux. This is viewed on a Windows device.

To change the User-Agent to Linux, use the following command:
[Shell command: Set User-Agent header to Linux]

Executing this command returns a response with the Linux logo gone.

Next, set the User-Agent to both Linux and Xbox:
[Shell command: Set User-Agent header to Linux Xbox]

Executing this command gives the flag inside the body of the page.
