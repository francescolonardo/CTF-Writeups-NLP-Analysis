Title: Hidden Flag in CSS
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: None
Tools used: None
Keywords: secret, hidden, HTML source

#discovery
If we right click -> inspect and look at the sources tab, we find that some of the assets are in a suspiciously named folder called "secret".
If we navigate to the secret suburl, we find a website that says "Finally. You almost found me. you are doing well".

#discovery
We are on the right track. If we repeat the same process as before, we find that there is another suspiciously named folder, "hidden", so we navigate to it.

#discovery
We keep on repeating this process until we reach a website that says "Finally. You found me. But can you see me".

#countermeasures
The flag is probably hidden by the css. We can just look at the HTML source to get the flag.
