    "Analyze the Python code for the challenge that manages a market API.",
    "Understand that the customer eligibility to purchase exclusive items on the API depends on their fame and the sum of their point history.",
    "Identify a bug in the API where the index page is unauthenticated.",
    "Register as a new user on the API.",
    "Review the battle endpoint in which fame can hypothetically be increased, but as LOYALTY_SYSTEM_ACTIVE is set to False, it is impossible.",
    "Examine the buy endpoint to understand purchasing requests and conditions.",
    "Note that the code introduced a problem when attempting to add to an immutable namedtuple, which raises an AttributeError when performing the assignment.",
    "Realize that despite this raised exception, point history is successfully modified with each request to buy an item.",
    "Understand that while the namedtuple and tuple are immutable, if they contain mutable objects, those can still be modified in place.",
    "Learn that the += operator is not equivalent to an operation x = x + y in Python as it is in some other languages. This is because += performs the operation in place when possible and subsequently tries to assign the result back to the variable.",
    "Understand that the list was already successfully modified by the time an error was raised in the assignment step.",
    "To complete the challenge, send purchase requests to the API to increase loyalty point history a minimum of 1337 times.",
    "Unlock and buy the 'flagsword', completing the challenge."
