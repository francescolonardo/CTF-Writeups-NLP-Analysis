Title: Cookie Manipulation to Gain Administrative Privileges
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: Session Management
Tools used: Browser Developer Tools
Keywords: Cookies, Privilege Escalation, Unauthorized Access

#overview
During a CTF event, I came across a web application that utilized cookies to store user session information. This caught my attention, as manipulating cookies can sometimes lead to privilege escalation or unauthorized access to restricted resources.

#analysis
To test for cookie manipulation vulnerabilities, I logged in to the application with a regular user account and examined the cookies using my browser's developer tools. I noticed that there was a cookie named "role" with a value of "user". This led me to suspect that the application might be using this cookie to determine the user's privileges.

#attack_execution
I decided to manipulate the "role" cookie to see if I could gain administrative privileges. I changed the cookie value from "user" to "admin" and refreshed the web page. Upon doing so, I gained access to an administrative panel that was previously hidden.

Inside the administrative panel, I found the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge.

This CTF writeup highlights the importance of implementing secure methods for handling user sessions and privileges in web applications, such as server-side session management. By manipulating the "role" cookie, I was able to escalate my privileges and gain unauthorized access to the administrative panel, where I found the flag needed to complete the challenge.
