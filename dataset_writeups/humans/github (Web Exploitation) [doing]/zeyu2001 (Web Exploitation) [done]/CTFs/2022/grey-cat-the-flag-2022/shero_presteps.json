    "Analysed PHP code and identified it will execute 'cat' command when specified in the GET request parameter 'f'.",
    "Understood that a regex filter restricts characters that can be included in the 'f' parameter.",
    "Listed out permitted characters to craft an effective attack payload.",
    "Bypassed character filter using wildcard '?' to match any single character in command arguments.",
    "Used wildcard '?' to access '/etc/hosts' file.",
    "Read an interesting binary '/readflag' using 'cat' command.",
    "Downloaded and decompiled the found binary.",
    "In the decompiled code, identified a string 'sRPd45w_0' which is a rearrangement of 'P4s5_w0Rd'.",
    "Understood that pipe character '|' is allowed, thus utilizing it to terminate the 'cat' command and run new command.",
    "Used character substitution '$()' to get the required strings for password.",
    "Executed '/usr/bin/strings /readflag' to read strings from the binary without actually running it.",
    "Filtered output to get only the relevant 'P4s5_w0Rd' string using '/etc/alternatives/nawk'.",
    "Constructed a regex pattern to extract only the string 'P4s5_w0Rd'.",
    "Passed the obtained string as an argument to '/readflag' using character substitution, which resulted in 'Wrong Password!' message.",
    "Identified the need to rearrange 'P4s5_w0Rd' into 'sRPd45w_0' to get the correct password.",
    "Developed a script which aims to index the characters in 'P4s5_w0Rd' string and reconstructs it into 'sRPd45w_0'.",
    "Ran the script and yielded the payload to rearrange password.",
    "Appended the obtained payload to '/readflag' command in the 'f' GET parameter to finally get the flag 'grey{r35p3c7_70_b45h_m4573r_0dd14e9bc3172d16}'."
