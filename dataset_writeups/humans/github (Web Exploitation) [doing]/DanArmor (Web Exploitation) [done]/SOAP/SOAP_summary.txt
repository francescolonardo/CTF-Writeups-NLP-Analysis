Identify the XXE (XML external entity) vulnerability by inspecting static resources (F12 -> Sources in Google Chrome), finding `detailsCheck.js` and `xmlDetailsCheckPayload.js`.
Locate the endpoint for the POST request in the `index.html` file.
Determine the format for the XML request by clicking the button on the site and observing the request format in the `Network` tab.
Send a POST request with the XML payload to `<url_of_site>/data` to obtain the flag.
