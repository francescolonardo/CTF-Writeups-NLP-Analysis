Title: Bypassing Client-Side Validation for Hidden Flag Retrieval
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: Client-Side Validation
Tools used: Browser's Developer Tools
Keywords: Hidden Flag, Server-Side Validation, JavaScript Functions

#overview
In this CTF writeup, the author describes how they were able to uncover a hidden flag in a web application by bypassing the client-side validation.

#analysis
The author noticed that the web application had strict client-side validation in its registration form, with specific requirements for some fields. They hypothesized that bypassing the client-side validation could reveal a hidden flag.

To test their hypothesis, the author inspected the source code of the web page and identified the JavaScript functions responsible for the client-side validation. They then used the browser's developer tools to disable these functions and submitted the registration form with non-compliant input values.

Upon submitting the form with the client-side validation disabled, the application returned a response that included a hidden message with the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge. The flag was concealed within the server-side validation logic and was only revealed when the client-side validation was bypassed.

#attack_execution
This CTF writeup highlights the importance of implementing robust server-side validation and not solely relying on client-side validation for security. By bypassing the client-side validation, the author was able to uncover the hidden flag and complete the challenge.
