Title: XXE Attack to Exfiltrate Sensitive Data from Web Application
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: XXE Vulnerability
Tools used: None
Keywords: XML data, external entity, payload, file system, flag

#overview
The writeup describes an XXE (XML External Entity) attack that the author encountered during a CTF event. The author noticed that a web application processed XML data from users, which could be vulnerable to XXE attacks. The author crafted an XML payload containing an external entity that would reference a local file on the server, such as /etc/passwd, to test for an XXE vulnerability.

#analysis
The author submitted the payload to the web application and observed the response. If the application returned the content of the /etc/passwd file, it would confirm the presence of an XXE vulnerability. To exploit the XXE vulnerability and obtain the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge, the author modified the payload to reference the server's file system location containing the flag.

#attack_execution
After submitting the modified payload, the web application returned the content of the flag file, allowing the author to obtain the flag needed to complete the challenge. This CTF writeup highlights the importance of securely handling and processing XML data in web applications to prevent XXE vulnerabilities. By exploiting the XXE vulnerability, the author was able to access sensitive data on the server and obtain the flag needed to complete the challenge.
