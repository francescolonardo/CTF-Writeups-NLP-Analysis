# Two For One

In this challenge, we had to authenticate as the admin user in a 2FA-enabled environment.

The feedback feature of the site had an XSS vulnerability, allowing us to perform a CSRF on the admin to reset their 2FA code.

This allowed us to steal the 2FA token:

This token can then be used by any authenticator application (e.g. Google Authenticator) to generate the admin 2FA codes. With the 2FA code in hand, we can once again perform a CSRF to steal the admin's secrets:

The flag is contained in the secret.
