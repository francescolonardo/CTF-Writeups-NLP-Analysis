    "Identify that the goal of this CTF problem is to bypass WAF protection to access local resources",
    "Study the provided Python script and identify that the program attempts to validate IP addresses and checks if IP matches certain values to confirm its a valid non-private IP",
    "Note the condition within the 'admin_status' function that only returns the flag if the request is coming from a '127.0.0.1' IP address",
    "Recognize that the 'valid_ip' function restricts usage of 0, 10, 127, certain ranges of 172, 169, and 192 IPs which includes the localhost (127.0.0.1)",
    "Identify the possibility of representing the localhost (127.0.0.1) in a different notation to bypass the restrictions set in the 'valid_ip' function",
    "Use the octal notation of 127.0.0.1 IP address which is 0177.0.0.1 to bypass the restrictions",
    "Make a HTTP request to 'http://0177.0.0.1/admin-status' from the localhost",
