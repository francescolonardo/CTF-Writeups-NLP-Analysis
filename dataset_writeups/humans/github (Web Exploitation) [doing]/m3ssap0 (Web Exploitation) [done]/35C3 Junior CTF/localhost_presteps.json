    "Identifying two significant functions: The first function sets specific server response headers if the request comes from '127.0.0.1', and the second function is used to proxy images.",

    "Noting that an image is necessary to exploit the service because the 'Content-Type' is strictly checked and some extensions, namely, '.jpg', '.png', and '.gif', are blacklisted in the header-setting function.",
    "Selecting an image: 'img/paperbots.svg' provided by the server that can be used for exploiting the service.",
    "Making a GET request to 'http://35.207.189.79/api/proxyimage?url=http://127.0.0.1:8075/img/paperbots.svg' to trick the server into thinking that the request is coming from the same host.",
