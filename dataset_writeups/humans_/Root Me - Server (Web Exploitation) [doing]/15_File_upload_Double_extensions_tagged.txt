#context
Referring to the documentation provided along with this challenge, I wrote a quick php script and saved it as php_shell.php.jpg.

#exploitation
Sometimes you can trick the web server into accepting your php file by adding an acceptable file extension (jpg, png, gif) to the end of the php file extension. After uploading the file, we navigate to it and inject our command into the url. ‘…..php_shell.php.jpg?command=cat ../../../.passwd’

#code
None

#countermeasures
None
