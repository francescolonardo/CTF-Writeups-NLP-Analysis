Title: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) Attack via User Profile
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
Tools used: None
Keywords: IDOR, direct object reference, web application, user profile, vulnerability, sensitive data, malicious request, access controls, authorization, authentication

#overview
During a CTF competition, the author encountered a web application that allowed users to view and edit their profile information through a dedicated page. Suspecting that the application might be vulnerable to IDOR, the author crafted a malicious request containing a direct object reference to another user's profile to test for the vulnerability.

#analysis
Upon submitting the crafted request to the application, it accessed and displayed the other user's sensitive information, confirming the presence of an IDOR vulnerability. To obtain the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge, the author needed to use the IDOR vulnerability to access and display a specific user's private data.

#attack_execution
After researching the application's structure and available resources, the author crafted a suitable request containing a direct object reference to the desired user's profile and submitted it to the application's user profile page. The server successfully responded with the desired user's sensitive information, displaying the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge.

To properly secure web applications against IDOR vulnerabilities, it's important to implement proper authorization and authentication controls, use indirect object references, and perform access controls on sensitive data. By exploiting the IDOR vulnerability, the author was able to access and modify sensitive data, obtain confidential information, and complete the Web Exploitation challenge.
