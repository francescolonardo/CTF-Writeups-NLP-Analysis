The blog contains links to 3 log files.
As per hints in challenge description we are supposed to find more log files and as an assumption one of them will contain the flag

On the basis of the URL of the 3 available log files I created a small custom wordlist :


then I used `ffuf` to fuzz the challenge site to find more logsâ€¦

in the result I gathered over 1900 logs!

After this I attempted to curl them and find `sdctf` in them but it did not work so flag wasnâ€™t available directly. Then I downloaded all available logs ðŸ˜ž using wget

After wasting some hours :

so `-v` is used for invert grep, I used it because I was looking for unusual stuff, if you look at the log most of them have these keywords like SELL etc which were normal text

so here we can see that some of the bash history is leaked

and a password
