Titanic

Solved By : thewhiteh4t


In this challenge we were given a website of a company
Two things which instantly caught attention were URL Capture and Admin buttons
URL capture service accepts a URL and takes screenshot of the webpage



Admin page got a login
First idea was to try http://localhost and it worked




This is same as the loading splash screen I saw while loading the challenge website
Next I checked robots.txt and got 200 and this revealed a new path /server-status



Next I obviously tried to access /server-status and got 200 again



And in the logs you can see the login credentials!
