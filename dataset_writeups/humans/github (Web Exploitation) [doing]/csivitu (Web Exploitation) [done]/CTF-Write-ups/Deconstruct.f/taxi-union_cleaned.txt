This solution demonstrates a SQL Injection attack to solve a CTF challenge. The script also works for the `Gate Keeper` challenge. Here's a high-level explanation of the Python script:
[Import the necessary libraries: `requests` and `string`.
Initialize an empty `flag` variable, and define the search domain containing all possible characters.
Set the challenge, URL, check, key, and column variables based on the challenge being solved (either "taxi union" or "gate keeper").
Enter an infinite loop that iterates through each character in the search domain.
For each character, create a payload containing a SQL injection query using the current flag and character.
Send an HTTP POST request to the URL with the payload as the data.
Check if the expected response text is found in the received response.
If the expected response is found, add the character to the flag and print it.
Break the loop once the flag is found.]

The script automates the process of testing various payloads to exploit the SQL Injection vulnerability and retrieve the flag.
