Assume I'm trying to create a taxonomy to categorize a set of actions taken from web application CTF writeups.
The aim is to develop a hierarchy that allows these actions to be grouped under categories and subcategories, making them easily identifiable and organized.

Please reply with a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    "Sub-category of example 1": [ "...", "...", ...],
    "Sub-category of example 2": [ "...", "...", ...],
    ...
}

Return in response just the JSON object, ensuring no additional content or remarks are added.

Generic (not about this category) example of input:
[
    "Visited the website.",
    "Accessed the webpage.",
    "Navigate to the '/example' route.",
    "Observe the form to fill.",
    "Submit the form.",
    "Find the input box.",
    "Click the submit button.",
    ...
]

Desired corresponding output example:
{
    "Page Visits and Navigations" : [
        "Visited the website.",
        "Accessed the webpage.",
        "Navigate to the '/example' route."
    ],
    "Website Interactions and Inputs" : [
        "Observe the form to fill.",
        "Submit the form.",
        "Find the input box.",
        "Click the submit button."
    ]
    ...
}

In this specific case, the goal is to find relevant sub-categories to the "Web Interaction and Navigation" category, whose description is as follows:
`Engage in activities like browsing, understanding web functions, analyzing underlying web elements, tracking user behavior, making direct interactions with web servers, and manipulating URLs or browser behaviors.`

Given the actions listed below, please segment them all into relevant sub-categories that capture their essence and relationship.
