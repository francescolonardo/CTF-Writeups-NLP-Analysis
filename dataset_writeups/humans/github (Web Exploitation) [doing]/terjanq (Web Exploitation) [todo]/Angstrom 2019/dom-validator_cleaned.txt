We had a simple upload page that allowed you to upload a custom HTML page. You could report suspicious URLs to admin.
After uploading the page we get:

The script won't be executed because of the `DOMValidator.js` script:

It calculates some sort document's hash and then compares it with the original. 
I haven't even looked into the code because I already knew an unintended solution for this one. 

The page wasn't setting any `X-XSS-Protection` header so the `XSS-Auditor` in Chrome 74 (that's the version the admin uses) is set to `mode=filter` so any reflected XSS will be filtered and not executed. 

So I appended the `xss=<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/crypto-js/3.1.2/rollups/sha512.js">` parameter to the query so the `sha512.js` script will be filtered and the `DOMValidator.js` will crash. Hence, `<script>alert('pwned')</script>` will be executed.

After sending that URL to the admin we get the flag.
