    "Research and study the basics of SQL injection (SQLi) to understand how to manipulate SQL queries through user input.",
    "Identify that the goal of SQL injection in this challenge is to create a query condition that is always true, such as using '1=1'.",
    "Observe that the challenge provides feedback on the resulting SQL query, using this information to inform the injection strategy.",
    "Craft an SQL injection payload that ensures the query remains valid. In this case, the payload is '' or 'a'='a.",
    "Understand that the missing closing quote in the payload ('a'='a) will be automatically added by the server, completing the SQL query.",
    "Recognize that the server's lack of input sanitization allows the injection to manipulate the search functionality.",
    "Use the payload to exploit the vulnerability, which causes the server to return all the data from the database due to the always-true condition.",
    "Acknowledge that this vulnerability could allow a hacker to access sensitive data from the database."
