Import necessary libraries (`requests` and `string`) and initialize an empty flag variable.
Define the search domain containing all possible characters and set challenge-specific variables.
Enter an infinite loop iterating through each character in the search domain.
Create a payload containing a SQL injection query using the current flag and character.
Send an HTTP POST request to the URL with the payload as the data.
Check if the expected response text is found in the received response.
If the expected response is found, add the character to the flag and print it.
Break the loop once the flag is found, exploiting the SQL Injection vulnerability.
