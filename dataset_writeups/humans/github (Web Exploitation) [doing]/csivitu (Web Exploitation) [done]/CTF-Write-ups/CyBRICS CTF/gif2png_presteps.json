    "Confirmed the challenge 'Gif2png' requires interaction with a Flask application.",
    "Identified the source code of the application that by analyzing a Python script.",
    "Focused on the command line subprocess interaction in this line: 'subprocess.Popen(f\"ffmpeg -i 'uploads/{file.filename}' \\\"uploads/{uid}/%03d.png\\\"\", shell=True)'.",
    "Identified the above critical line that could potentially lead to Remote Command Execution (RCE) through its interaction with the filename being uploaded.",
    "Started preparing an attack by attempting to exploit the RCE vulnerability by using the '-vf drawtext=...' option within the 'ffmpeg' command in the application to inject a 'grep' command to look for the flag in the main.py file.",
    "Crafted a payload for this on the form 'csictf.gif' -vf drawtext=\\\"text=$(grep ffLaG main.py)\\\"'.gif'. The crafted payload was intended to be used as the filename of the gif file being uploaded.",
    "Uploaded the gif with the crafted filename to the application.",
    "Analyzed the resulting PNG file from the uploaded and converted gif and found the flag written on it.",
    "Extracted the flag, which turned out to be 'cybrics{imagesaresocoolicandrawonthem}'."
