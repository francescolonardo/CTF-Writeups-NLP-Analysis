Title: Suspicious robots.txt
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: Base64 decoding
Tools used: None
Keywords: base64, suburl

#context
The challenge name seems to be either an allusion to the text font Roboto or /robots.txt.

#discovery
As investigating the text font files seems more complicated, let's first look at /robots.txt. The text in here disallow looks suspicious.

#code
The double equal sign suggests that it's base 64. However, if we try to decode it with an online decoder, it seems like the base 64 is a little malformed. As the base 64 text spans across three lines, it suggests that it is actually three separate strings.

#discovery
If we decode each line separately, we find that the second line gives us a valid path, specifically js/myfile.txt.

#exploitation
If we navigate to the suburl, we get the flag.
