Examine the website and find the `database.sql` file containing password hashes.
Use CrackStation to crack the hashes, obtaining credentials for the manager and admin users.
Log in with the manager credentials, viewing a list of toys and properties.
Identify the flag in the database with an "approved" value set to 0.
Find the `/api/toylist` endpoint in the `challenge/routes/index.js` file, and note that the "approved" value must be 1 for the admin user.
Notice the potential SQL injection vulnerability in the `database.js` file.
Attempt various SQL injection payloads on the main login page, ultimately using the payload `admin' --` to bypass authentication and reveal the flag.
