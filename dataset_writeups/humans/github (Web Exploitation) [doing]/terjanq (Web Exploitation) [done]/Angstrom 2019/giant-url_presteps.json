    "The website interface allows for creating redirect URLs, changing the admin's password, and reporting URLs.",
    "The website isn't protected by CSRF tokens but employs SameSite=Lax cookies. Hence there can't be any POST requests across different origins.",
    "The challenge is to change the admin's password, which surprisingly can be passed as a URL parameter.",
    "An insight into the problematic code in the /redirect shows a potential for XSS injection but this is blocked by the Content-Security-Policy header.",
    "We notice that the anchor element allows for a 'ping' attribute. This creates an opportunity since 'ping' sends a POST request when the link is clicked.",
    "To exploit this, we insert code into the /redirect that will change the password of the admin when the admin clicks the URL.",
    "The payload we insert is a URL, caused by clicking on it, generates a password change request for the admin account with a new password.",
    "Finally, we log in using the newly changed credentials pertaining to the admin account and retrieve the flag."
