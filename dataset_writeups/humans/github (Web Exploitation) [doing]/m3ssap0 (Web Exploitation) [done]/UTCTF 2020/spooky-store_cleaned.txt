The web page sends data via XML envelops, using two Javascript files, when buttons are pressed.

The first script crafts the XML envelope.

The second script sends the XML envelope and reads the answer.

Performing a POST request passing a wrong `productId` will trigger an error.

The passed parameter is reflected to the response, so if the system is vulnerable to XXE you can read files on the server.

You can craft a payload and discover the flag into `/etc/passwd`.
