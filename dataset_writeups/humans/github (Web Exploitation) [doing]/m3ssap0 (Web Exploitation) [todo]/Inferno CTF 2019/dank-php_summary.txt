Analyze the website's source code and identify checks to bypass in order to obtain the flag.
Replicate a serialized input to pass via the `id` HTTP GET parameter and create a payload with a serialized object.
Bypass the first check using PHP serialization and the `R` clause, then craft the complete URL with the serialized object.
Obtain the first part of the flag from the response.
Bypass the second check using a technique to craft a non-alphanumeric payload that performs logic operations with non-alphanumeric variables.
Craft the payload using bitwise XOR operations in PHP to create a variable with a non-alphanumeric name.
Execute the content of the GET parameter with the crafted code.
Combine the payload and crafted URL to invoke the final URL, and pass the name of the function to call via the `_` GET parameter.
Retrieve the complete flag from the web page's response.
