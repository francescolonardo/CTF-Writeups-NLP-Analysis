Title: Bypassing Web Application Firewall to Perform SQL Injection

In a recent CTF event, I came across a web application with a login form that seemed to be protected by a Web Application Firewall (WAF). My suspicion arose when I tried to input some typical SQL Injection payloads, and the WAF blocked my attempts, indicating that the form might still be vulnerable to SQL Injection, but with the added challenge of bypassing the WAF.

To bypass the WAF, I began by analyzing its behavior and identifying the specific patterns and keywords it was blocking. Once I had a better understanding of the WAF's rules, I crafted an SQL Injection payload that would evade detection by using a combination of encoding, obfuscation, and alternative syntax.

For example, if the WAF was blocking the keyword "UNION", I could use an equivalent representation like "/!50000UNION/" to bypass the filter. Similarly, I obfuscated other parts of the payload, such as using "1//AND//1=0" instead of the more straightforward "1 AND 1=0".

After crafting my WAF-evasive SQL Injection payload, I submitted it through the login form, successfully bypassing the WAF and exploiting the underlying SQL Injection vulnerability.

By further exploring the database and exploiting the SQL Injection vulnerability, I was able to locate the flag required for the Web Exploitation challenge.

This CTF writeup highlights the importance of not only relying on WAFs for web application security but also ensuring that the application code itself is secure. By bypassing the WAF and exploiting the SQL Injection vulnerability, I was able to access sensitive data and retrieve the flag needed to complete the challenge.
