Title: Accessing /admin endpoint with JWT Attack
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: JWT Attack
Tools used: Python

#context
You find an API with 3 endpoints:
/key (accessible with GET)
/auth (accessible with POST)
/admin (accessible with POST)

#discovery
There is sure to be important data in the /admin endpoint, I have to access it.
I get a public key in the /key endpoint and I bring it to the human format.
I get the JWT in the /auth endpoint.

#exploitation
After reading a little, I came to the conclusion that it is necessary to send a token signed by the received public key (alg: RSA) while the server is waiting for a token with the signature HMAC (HS256/HS512).
The HS256 algorithm uses the secret key (Secret Key) to sign and authenticate the token's Header and Payload.
If the signature algorithm is changed from RS256 to HS256, On the authentication server, use the public key (Public Key) as the secret key (Secret Key) and use the HS256 algorithm to confirm the signature. In these cases, the attacker gets the public key (Public Key) to sign the token and verify the signature with the HS256 algorithm to make a JWT Attack.
Thanks to this, the server will automatically accept my token, I try to create and sign a token in python.
I get the token which I need to send.
I send the signed token.
