Analyze `http://35.207.189.79/pyserver/server.py` to find two interesting methods related to security headers and proxying images.

Understand the server's functionality in adding security headers and proxying images with basic validation checks.

Identify that the server listens for incoming HTTP requests on all available network interfaces at port 8075.

Determine that an image is required to exploit the service, and choose `img/paperbots.svg` as the image.

Perform the exploit with an HTTP GET request, fetching the image from a remote server via a proxy endpoint (or using `0.0.0.0` for the IP address).

Receive the response containing the flag.
