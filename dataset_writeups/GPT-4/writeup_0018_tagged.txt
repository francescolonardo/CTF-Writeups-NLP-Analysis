#overview
The writeup describes how the author bypassed client-side JavaScript validation to gain unauthorized access to a restricted area in a web application during a CTF competition. The author discovered that the validation function checked if the user input matched a hardcoded value, which allowed them to enter the correct code and retrieve the flag needed to complete the challenge.

#analysis
The writeup emphasizes the importance of using server-side validation in addition to client-side validation for securing web applications. By relying solely on client-side validation, the web application was vulnerable to unauthorized access, as demonstrated by the author during the CTF competition.

#attack_execution
The author inspected the source code of the web page and located the JavaScript file responsible for validating the user input. They examined the validation function to understand its logic and identify any weaknesses. Once they discovered that the validation function checked if the user input matched a hardcoded value, they were able to bypass the validation and gain access to the restricted area where the flag was hidden.
