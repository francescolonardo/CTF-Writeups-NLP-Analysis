Title: Broken Authentication and Session Management Attack

During a CTF competition, I encountered a web application that allowed users to login to the system and manage their profiles. Given the potential security risks associated with user authentication and session management, I suspected that the application might be vulnerable to Broken Authentication and Session Management, a type of vulnerability that allows attackers to bypass authentication and hijack user sessions.

To test for Broken Authentication and Session Management, I crafted a malicious payload containing a tampered session ID, such as 1234567890abcdef, and submitted it to the application's login form. If the application allowed the payload to execute and bypassed the authentication process, it would confirm the presence of a Broken Authentication and Session Management vulnerability.

Upon submitting the crafted payload to the application, it indeed executed and bypassed the authentication process, confirming the vulnerability. To obtain the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge, I needed to use the Broken Authentication and Session Management vulnerability to hijack the session of a logged-in user.

After researching the application's session management and cookie handling, I crafted a suitable payload containing a tampered session ID that would hijack the session of a logged-in user, such as Cookie: PHPSESSID=1234567890abcdef. The server successfully recognized the payload and responded with the session of the logged-in user.

This CTF writeup highlights the importance of properly securing web applications against Broken Authentication and Session Management vulnerabilities by using secure session management, implementing proper authentication controls, and validating user input. By exploiting the vulnerability, I was able to bypass authentication, hijack user sessions, and complete the Web Exploitation challenge.
