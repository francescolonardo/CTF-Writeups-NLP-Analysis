    "Noticed the feature using SQLite through filters and SQL statements",
    "Created exploit using SQL injection: 'adm' || trim('in', ` Password: `) || ''",
    "Discovered that `||` is the SQLite concatenation operator and is used to join strings together",
    "Understood that trim(string, character) will remove `character` from `string`. Therefore, ' AND password=' is treated as a string and hence, ignored",
    "Executed SQL statement: SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='adm' || trim('in',' AND password=') || ''",
    "Recognized that this SQL statement is equivalent to SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='adm' || 'in' || ''",
    "Realized finally that both SQL statements are identical to 'SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='admin''",
    "Logged in as admin using the discovered SQL injection",
    "Checked the filter page again to see any changes",
    "Attempted the third web Gauntlet where the length requirement is reduced",
    "Tried the previously discovered SQL injection, found that it still works"
