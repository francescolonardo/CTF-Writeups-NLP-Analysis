Description "You may think I walk with no 'name' because it can be changed whenever I want. I am a 'person' whose 'secret' can never be found. Can you find this 'person's 'secret'?
(I love you 8000.)"

This challenge involves exploiting the server script through Tornado template injection to obtain the cookie secret and forging a signed cookie to access the flag.

- The server script runs on `http://chall.csivit.com:30279/`. Input is taken as the "icecream" value. 
 
- A secure cookie is being set and compared to print a flag value. In tornado, signed cookies contain the encoded value of the cookie
  alongwith a timestamp and an HMAC signature. Such cookies are supported by the set_secure_cookie and get_secure_cookie methods which require a specific secret key: cookie_secret.

- Upon visiting `http://chall.csivit.com:30279/?icecream={{globals()}}`, you see something useful:
`'application': <tornado.web.Application object at 0x7f2976579750>`

- You now know that the name of the variable `tornado.web.Application(...)` is `application`.

- Run the server script with the exploit payload `http://chall.csivit.com:30279/?icecream={{application.settings["cookie_secret"]}}` to get the cookie_secret value `MangoDB` displayed on the website.
  
- Replace the value of the secure cookie `admin` to the required comparison value `true` to obtain a signed cookie on the browser. Now, replace the signed cookie generated upon running the server script with the one obtained after the secure cookie value was set to `true`. This results in a cookie which looks like the following. Note `dHJ1ZQ==` is base64 for `true`.
"2|1:0|10:1594808471|5:admin|8:dHJ1ZQ==|5da7d1e446451e825e42001e7f07360e2e2e77c9c68b14fca1a517259712cdac"

- Upon reloading the server script, the text on the website would change from `Unfortunately, you aren't worthy` to the flag value.
