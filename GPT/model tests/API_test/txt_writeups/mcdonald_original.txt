Challenge

Our web admin name's "Mc Donald" and he likes apples and always forgets to throw away his apple cores..
http://35.207.91.38

Solution
Visiting http://35.207.91.38/robots.txt will reveal the following content.

User-agent: *
Disallow: /backup/.DS_Store

So the http://35.207.91.38/backup/.DS_Store will download a .DS_Store file.
According to Wikipedia:

In the Apple macOS operating system, .DS_Store is a file that stores custom attributes of its containing folder, such as the position of icons or the choice of a background image.

The https://github.com/lijiejie/dsstoreexp script could be used to download and extract hidden data.

./ds_store_exp.py http://35.207.91.38/backup/.DS_Store

The flag will be into backup/b/a/c/flag.txt.
