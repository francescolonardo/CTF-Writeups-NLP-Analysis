    "Registered a new account on the provided URL",
    "Checked how the OTP verification is performed by analyzing the provided source code",
    "Couldn't find any flaws in the OTP verification logic hence proceeded to find vulnerabilities in other functions",
    "Checked search function for potential vulnerabilities",
    "Identified potential SQL Injection vulnerability in the search function's MySQL query builder through string manipulation",
    "Noted that certain characters and strings were restricted like space, 'AND', 'OR', etc.",
    "Bypassed the SQL Injection protection through MySQL comments that are treated like spaces",
    "Crafted payload '/search?q=socengexp'/**/AANDND/**/(SUBSTR(otp,<POSITION>,1))='<GUESS>' to brute force the OTP character by character",
    "Used the obtained OTP to verify and login into the system",
    "Gained access to '/cornelia' URL which performs GET request on chosen URL",
    "Identified Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in '/cornelia'",
    "Realized SSRF couldn't be exploited directly due to validation that prevents from specifying 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1'",
    "Leveraged the fact that the server follows redirects and used PHP to redirect to 'localhost:8081/flag' to access the flag",
    "Retrieved the flag 'CTFSG{All_T00_W3ll_T3n_M1nutes_V3rs1on_Taylors_Version}'"
