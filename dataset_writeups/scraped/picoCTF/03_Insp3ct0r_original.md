Title: Insp3ct0r

Visiting the website, we don't see anything out of the ordinary.
We right click and choose to inspect the source code.
Here we get the first third of the flag, included as a html comment.
The second part of the flag comes from the referenced CSS file mycss.cs.
The last part comes from the Javascript scipt myjs.js.
Hence combining the 3 parts gives the flag.
