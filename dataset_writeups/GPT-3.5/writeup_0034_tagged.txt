Title: File Inclusion Vulnerability in a Web Application
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: File Inclusion
Tools used: None
Keywords: File Inclusion, PHP, Arbitrary Code Execution, Sensitive Data

#overview
During a CTF competition, the author encountered a web application that included a file upload feature allowing users to upload images to the server. Suspecting that the application might be vulnerable to File Inclusion attacks, the author tested for this vulnerability by uploading a malicious PHP file named "shell.php." The author was able to exploit the vulnerability and execute arbitrary code on the server.

#analysis
To exploit the vulnerability, the author navigated to the uploaded file's URL and appended "?file=shell.php" to the URL. The application included the "shell.php" file in the server-side code and executed the code contained within it, allowing the author to execute arbitrary code on the server. The author crafted a payload that allowed access to a sensitive file containing confidential data, demonstrating the potential risks associated with File Inclusion attacks.

#attack_execution
The author was able to access the sensitive file and recommend proper countermeasures to prevent these types of attacks. These countermeasures include implementing proper input validation controls, using safe file upload handling techniques, and validating user input.
