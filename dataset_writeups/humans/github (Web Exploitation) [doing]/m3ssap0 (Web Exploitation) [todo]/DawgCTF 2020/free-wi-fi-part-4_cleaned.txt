Connecting to the web site, two interesting cookies are set.

Analyzing the PCAP file some POST requests passing `passcode` value can be found. 
Considering the SHA-1 algorithm discovered before in the cookie value and applying that algorithm to the wi-fi nonces captured, you will discover that `passcode` values are just the first 8 chars of the hashed `nonce` value.

The same process can be applied to your `nonce` in order to perform a POST request.
