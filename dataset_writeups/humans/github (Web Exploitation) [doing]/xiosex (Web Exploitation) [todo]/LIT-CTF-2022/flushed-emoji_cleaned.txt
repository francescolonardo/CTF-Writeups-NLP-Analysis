This challenge has several vulnerabilities. The first vulnerability is related to the password field. If you check the code, you will notice the vulnerability of SSTI
For example, if you enter the following payload

There is also a sql injection vulnerability in the `data-server` project

Now we use SSTI to execute command

If we print the main.py file, we will encounter the address http://172.24.0.8:8080/runquery, this address is not accessible from the outside, and this shows that we do not have access to the data-server program from the outside.

In the next step, we should send requests containing sql to the address http://172.24.0.8:8080/runquery

There are a few points in the script above
	Because there is no curl in the server, we had to use a python script to send the request.
	The server filters the character “.” , to bypass this filter I coded the script with base64.
