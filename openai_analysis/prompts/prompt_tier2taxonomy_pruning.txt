I'll provide you with some context.
Assume I am tasked with creating a taxonomy to categorize a set of actions taken from web application CTF writeups.

This is my current taxonomy with two levels of depth. I need to prune the second level (sub-categories) of the "{tier1_category_name}" category.
```

5. Exploitation Techniques and Payload Handling
Description: Encompasses methods attackers use to exploit vulnerabilities, including the development and deployment of payloads.
Subcategories:
    - Injection Attacks (SQL, XSS, etc.): Relates to inserting malicious data into systems.
    - Vulnerability Identification & Exploitation: Focuses on finding and leveraging system weaknesses.
    - Web Security Techniques & Attack Mechanics: Relates to general methods and tactics for compromising web security.
    - HTTP Request Smuggling & Redirect Exploitation: Involves manipulating web requests for malicious purposes.
    - Exploit & Payload Development: Relates to creating tools or scripts to exploit vulnerabilities.

6. Network and System Analysis
Description: Pertains to activities related to understanding and manipulating network communications and interactions with servers and systems.
Subcategories:
    - Networking & Communication Protocols: Involves understanding how different network protocols function and are structured.
    - Proxy & Microservice Communication: Relates to manipulating or understanding the communications between different services.
    - IP, DNS & Protocol Analysis: Involves understanding and potentially exploiting networking systems and structures.
    - Network & Server Configurations and Interactions: Relates to how systems are set up and communicate with each other.

7. Debugging, Monitoring, and Troubleshooting
Description: Covers actions taken to understand abnormal behaviors, monitor activities, and fix issues within a web application.
Subcategories:
    - Troubleshooting & Debugging Techniques: Involves methods and processes to identify and resolve issues.
    - Error, Response, & Server Message Analysis: Relates to understanding and exploiting the messages and errors systems provide.
    - Logging & Behavior Observation: Involves monitoring and understanding the recorded activities of systems and users.

8. Cryptography, Encoding, and Decoding Techniques
Description: Focuses on activities related to encryption, hashing, and the encoding or decoding of data for various purposes.
Subcategories:
    - Base64, JWT, CAPTCHA & Encryption Techniques: Involves methods and tools used to encrypt, decrypt, or otherwise obscure data.
    - Cryptographic Analysis & Exploits: Relates to finding vulnerabilities or insights within cryptographic implementations.
    - Hashing, Decoding & Encoding Techniques: Focuses on methods to change how data is represented.

9. Tools, Scripting, and System Interactions
Description: Encompasses the use of external tools, scripts, and interactions with underlying operating systems to assist in the attack process.
Subcategories:
    - Custom Tools & Script Hosting: Involves using specialized software or scripts in the attack process.
    - Scripting Techniques, Automation & Shell Execution: Relates to automating processes or directly interfacing with system shells.
    - Operating System & Terminal Commands: Involves commands or actions taken within the system's primary interface.
    - Regular Expression & String Manipulation: Focuses on understanding and manipulating text or data streams.

10. Information Gathering and Security Analysis
Description: Involves researching, collecting data, and analyzing security aspects of a web application or the environment it resides in.
Subcategories:
    - Vulnerability Research: Involves understanding known vulnerabilities and how they might be relevant.
    - Reconnaissance & Server Discovery: Relates to the initial exploration and identification of systems or targets.
    - Web Security Concepts & Techniques: Focuses on broader security principles and their applications.

11. Documentation, Strategy, and Miscellaneous Techniques
Description: Covers general strategies, reviewing related documents, and a variety of other techniques that don't neatly fit into the other categories.
Subcategories:
    - Challenge Understanding & Gameplay Strategy: Relates to understanding the broader context of a challenge or attack scenario.
    - Documentation & Clues Review: Involves reviewing any provided information for insights.
    - Git Operations, Browser Behavior, & Mobile App Exploits: Diverse set of tactics, from leveraging version control insights to exploiting mobile apps.
    - Time-Based Analysis & Specific Techniques: Involves exploiting or analyzing systems based on timing or other specific techniques.
```

With a specific process, about the category "{tier1_category_name}", I have found the following sub-categories:
```
{taxonomy_tier2_{tier1_category_name}.txt}
```

Remove, from the latter, all the entries not strictly related to the category "{tier1_category_name}". I.e., remove everything that belongs to other categories (first level) and sub-categories (second level) of the current taxonomy.

Please provide me in ouput just the (updated) point {tier1_category_number} of the taxonomy of two levels of depth (that will be of three levels of depth now), without any additional information.
