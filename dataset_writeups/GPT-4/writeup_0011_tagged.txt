#overview
This writeup describes how I reverse engineered obfuscated JavaScript code to uncover a hidden flag in a web application as part of a CTF challenge.

#analysis
The web application featured an interactive puzzle, and after completing it, a message indicated that the flag was hidden within the JavaScript code. The code was heavily obfuscated, making it challenging to understand the logic and identify where the flag might be concealed.

To reverse engineer the obfuscated code, I used a combination of online tools and manual analysis. First, I used a JavaScript beautifier to reformat the code, making it more readable. Next, I analyzed the code's structure and identified key functions and variables that could potentially hold the flag.

Through careful analysis, I discovered a function that seemed to perform a series of transformations on a string of characters. I suspected that this function was responsible for decrypting the flag. I executed the function in the browser's developer console and provided the necessary input to reveal the decrypted flag.

#attack_execution
By reverse engineering the obfuscated JavaScript code, I was able to decrypt the hidden flag and complete the challenge. This writeup highlights the importance of understanding code obfuscation and reverse engineering techniques when attempting to uncover hidden information within a web application.
