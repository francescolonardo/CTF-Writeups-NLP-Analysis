A python source code of the application is given for this challenge.

Analyzing it, you can discover that during user registration data is packed with a format like `username:password:admin`.

The `admin` field can be `true` or `false` and during the normal registration process a `false` value is forced into the ACL.

There are no escaping countermeasures for `:` char, hence a record could be crafted and injected passing a password with that char, in order to bypass the `false` value forced, creating an admin account.

For example, you can use following value for the password during registration 'pwnd:true`.

Logging in with the created user will show the flag.
