#context
Connecting to the website will give us a login form. In the hints, it is given that the user is "admin".

#discovery
We tried logging in with the credentials "admin" and "admin," but it failed. We realized that the input we give is entering into the SQL command, so we have to use SQL injection techniques to exploit this.

#exploitation
We tried a common SQLi payload: `admin' or 1=1--`. This sets our own condition and passes the command. By adding " -- " we comment out the remaining part of the SQL command.

#discovery
Now we can see that we are logged in, but the flag is hidden.
We checked the source code of the page and found the flag.
