Analyze the HTML to find a comment indicating the location of the "src.tgz" file containing the project source code.

Extract the frontend and backend code from the "src.tgz" file.

Examine the backend file "app.rb" to discover the backend endpoint that returns the flag when the path "/admin" is accessed.

Identify vulnerable code in the frontend "view.php" file.

Craft an "id" parameter that bypasses the first two "if" statements in the PHP code by exploiting the lack of an "int" cast.

Use the crafted "id" parameter to make the "file_get_contents" instruction perform an HTTP GET call to the backend endpoint.

Access the backend endpoint at `$BACKEND/admin` to retrieve the flag.
