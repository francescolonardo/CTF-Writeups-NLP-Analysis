#context
Check source code. You can see that when an option is selected, you are redirected to, for example, https://facebook.com&h=......&#8230;.

#discovery
We need to figure out what the value followed by &h= is, so we can structure our redirect url accordingly. Using an online md5 hash to text converter, we see the value represents the hashed value of the particular url. MD5 hash https://google.com&#8217; and note the value.

#exploitation
Start tamper data and click the facebook link. Edit the url so the website redirects to ?url=https://google.com&h=<MD5hash of https://google.com>&#8217; instead of facebook. Then submit the page.
