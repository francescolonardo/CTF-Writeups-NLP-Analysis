Title: "Unrestricted File Upload"

During a CTF competition, I came across a web application that allowed users to upload files. The application had no restrictions on the type or size of the files that could be uploaded, which made it vulnerable to attacks.

To exploit this vulnerability, I uploaded a PHP shell script disguised as a harmless image file. The application allowed me to upload the file without any validation or sanitization, and it was saved to the server's file system.

With the PHP shell script uploaded, I was able to execute arbitrary commands on the server and gain control over it. I could access sensitive data, modify the application's code, and even launch further attacks against other systems.

To mitigate this vulnerability, I recommended that the application implement strict file upload restrictions, such as only allowing specific file types and enforcing file size limitations. Additionally, I suggested that the application implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent any attempts at uploading malicious files.

This CTF writeup highlights the importance of properly securing file upload functionality by implementing strict file upload restrictions and enforcing input validation and sanitization techniques. By exploiting the vulnerability, I was able to demonstrate the potential risks associated with an unrestricted file upload feature and recommend proper countermeasures to prevent these types of attacks.
