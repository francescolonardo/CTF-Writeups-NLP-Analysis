    "Analyzed the source code which indicates that for testing locally, `admin:admin` is the basic authentication credentials",
    "Identified an interesting functionality of the app that modifies the `services` object when POST-ing JSON to the `/change_status` endpoint using the `fast-json-patch`",
    "Researched and identified that a prototype pollution vulnerability exists in `applyPatch()`",
    "Realized that by POST-ing certain data (including `constructor/prototype/offline`), every object will now have the `offline` attribute",
    "Identified potential for serious exploits like RCE due to the presence of prototype injection vulnerability in server-side code",
    "Explored the potential of achieving RCE through exploiting the `ejs` module, by leveraging the `constructor/prototype/outputFunctionName`",
    "Identified that `ejs` is used as a library for templating in web applications",
    "Tested locally for potential RCE by POST-ing data that includes `constructor/prototype/outputFunctionName`",
