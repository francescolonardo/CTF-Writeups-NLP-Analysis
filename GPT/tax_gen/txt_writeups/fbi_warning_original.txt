The goal is to figure out the IP address of the poster, and this is possible to figure out through the tripcode ("ueyUrcwA").
We find some code snippets of futaba-ng online, which shows how the tripcode is generated. It is essentially
php
ID:".substr(crypt(md5($_SERVER["REMOTE_ADDR"].IDSEED.gmdate("Ymd", $time+9*60*60)),'id'),-8)

where IDSEED is some salt, where the default is 
php
define("IDSEED", 'idの種');

Since we know the time it was posted, it is easy to brute force the unknown octets of the IP address.
```php

define("IDSEED", 'idの種');
$time = 16385372593;
$target = "ueyUrcwA";
foreach(range(0, 256) as $a)
{
    foreach(range(0, 256) as $b)
    {
        foreach(range(0, 256) as $c)
        {
            $addr = "219" . "." . $a . "." . $b . "." . $c;
            //$g = substr(crypt(md5($addr.IDSEED.gmdate("Ymd", $time+96060)),'id'),-8);
            $g = substr(crypt(md5($addr.IDSEED."20211203"),'id'),-8);
            if ($g === $target)
            {
                echo $addr . "\n";
            }
        }
    }
}
?>
```
After a short amount of time, the correct IP pops out
hitcon{219.91.64.47
