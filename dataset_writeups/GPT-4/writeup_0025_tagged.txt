Title: Exploiting LFI to Retrieve Sensitive Configuration Files
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: Local File Inclusion (LFI)
Tools used: None
Keywords: CTF, vulnerability, configuration files, database credentials, flag

#overview
During a CTF event, the author discovered a web application that allowed users to view specific files on the server through a URL parameter. The author suspected that this could potentially be vulnerable to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) attack, enabling an attacker to access sensitive files on the server.

#analysis
To test for an LFI vulnerability, the author manipulated the URL parameter to view system files that shouldn't be accessible to a regular user. By accessing the /etc/passwd file, the author confirmed the presence of an LFI vulnerability. 

#attack_execution
To exploit this vulnerability, the author focused on retrieving sensitive configuration files from the server, which might contain important information such as database credentials or the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge. By manipulating the URL parameter, the author accessed various configuration files and eventually found a file containing the flag.

The author emphasizes the importance of implementing secure methods for handling user input in web applications to prevent LFI vulnerabilities. By exploiting the LFI vulnerability, the author was able to access sensitive configuration files and obtain the flag needed to complete the challenge.
