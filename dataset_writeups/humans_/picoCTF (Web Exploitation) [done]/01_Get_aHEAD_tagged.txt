Title: Get aHEAD
Topics: Web Exploitation, Information Gathering
Vulnerabilities: Improper use of HTTP request methods
Tools used: Burp Suite
Keywords: HTTP method, HEAD, MDN Web Docs

#context
Looking at the HTML of the website, we can see that both red and blue buttons make a request to the same URL, however with different HTTP request methods. We can make the educated guess that the flag will be accessible by using a different HTTP request method.

#discovery
Using the tool Burp Suite, we can try HTTP requests with different request methods. Unfortunately, both "PUT" and "DELETE" do not result in the flag. Looking at the MDN Web Docs, we can see that there are actually 9 different HTTP request methods, one of which being "HEAD".

#exploitation
As this challenge is named "Get aHEAD", we can conclude that we must use the "HEAD" method to get the flag.
