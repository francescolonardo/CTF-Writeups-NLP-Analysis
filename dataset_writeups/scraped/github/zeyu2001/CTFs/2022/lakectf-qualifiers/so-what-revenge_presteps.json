    "The challenge involves being given an assembly source file.",
    "There are a number of filters that are applied to the user's input.",
    "After passing through the filters, the input will be written to a binary file and then assembled and linked to the main function.",
    "A secondary function 'win' is also written and compiled.",
    "There are restrictions on the usage of certain characters, XOR operation, and ADD operation. The filters disallow printable shellcodes, shell spawning shenanigans, XOR operation, and ADD operation.",
    "The goal is to export a function 'win' in the shared library that runs the main.",
    "Workaround is found to create the required label using '.set' directive which allows using a quoted value that abides by the filters.",
    "Additional trick is used to reformulate the MOV operands with mathematical expressions that do not utilize banned digits.",
    "Another approach is found where instead of writing assembly code, a linker script is written that directly links to the libflag.so."
