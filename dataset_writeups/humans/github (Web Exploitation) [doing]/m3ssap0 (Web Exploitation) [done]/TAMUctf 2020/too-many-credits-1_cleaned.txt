The website allows you to increment your credits, but you have to get two thousand million credits (or more) in order to get the flag. Obviously, the credit generation can't be bruteforced/automated, because automation countermeasures are in place.

The `value` attribute is at the end as we supposed, so a malicuous payload can easily crafted, e.g.:

Using the Python script you can craft the cookie.

A Python script can be developed to perform all the reported operations.

And then performing the request you will get the flag.
