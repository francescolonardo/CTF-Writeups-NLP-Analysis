Title: Exposing Hidden Directories to Reveal Sensitive Information
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: Directory Enumeration
Tools used: Dirbuster
Keywords: hidden directories, brute force, database credentials, flag, misconfigured directories

#overview
During a CTF event, I encountered a web application with a seemingly simple interface, but suspected that there might be hidden directories containing sensitive information or the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge. 

#analysis
To uncover these hidden directories, I used a combination of directory enumeration and brute force techniques. Initially, I used a tool like Dirbuster to perform directory enumeration on the web application. Dirbuster generates a list of potential directory names by using a wordlist and sends requests to the application to see if any of the directories exist. As I ran Dirbuster, I discovered a hidden directory with a non-descriptive name, such as /a8f9c/. Upon navigating to the discovered directory, I found a file named config.php, which contained sensitive information, including database credentials.

With the database credentials in hand, I accessed the database and searched for the flag needed to complete the Web Exploitation challenge. By querying the database, I found a table containing the flag, which I then submitted to complete the challenge.

[CODE_REMOVED]

This CTF writeup highlights the importance of securing web applications against directory enumeration attacks and ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed through hidden or misconfigured directories. By exploiting the exposed hidden directory, I was able to access sensitive information and obtain the flag needed to complete the challenge.
