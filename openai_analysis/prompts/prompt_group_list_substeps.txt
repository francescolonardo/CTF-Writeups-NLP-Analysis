Assume you are tasked with creating a taxonomy to categorize a set of actions taken from web application CTF writeups. The aim is to develop a hierarchy that allows these actions to be grouped under broader themes significant in the realm of web security, making them easily identifiable and organized.

Please reply with a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    "Group 1": [ "...", "...", ...],
    "Group 2": [ "...", "...", ...],
    ...
}

Return in response just the JSON object, ensuring no additional content or remarks are added.

Example of input:
[
    "Execute ls command on the server using subprocess.Popen",
    "Access the website homepage",
    "Navigate to the bottom of the results.",
    "Use the mutool info -X command to verify collision1.pdf.",
    "Successfully log into the admin panel.",
    "Successfully log in to the system.",
    "Open a web browser.",
    "Analyze the entrypoint.sh bash file.",
    "Performed the action of accessing challenges."
    ...
]

Desired corresponding output example:
{
    "Command & Server Interactions": [

        "Use the mutool info -X command to verify collision1.pdf.",
        "Analyze the entrypoint.sh bash file."
    ],

        "Open a web browser.",
        "Performed the action of accessing challenges."
    ],
    ...
