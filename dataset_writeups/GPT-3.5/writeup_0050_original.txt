Title: "Unlocked Account"

In this CTF challenge, the objective was to exploit a web application to gain access to an administrator account. The website had a login page that allowed users to enter a username and password. The source code for the login page revealed that the authentication was performed using a simple SQL query. By manipulating the input fields, it was possible to bypass the authentication and gain access to the administrator account. The solution involved using SQL injection techniques to modify the SQL query in a way that allowed us to login as the administrator. The tool used for this challenge was SQLMap.
