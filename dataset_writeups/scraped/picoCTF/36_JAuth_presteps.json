    "We get a test user.",
    "If we log in, we get an empty page.",
    "Lets look at the login HTTP request. Hmmm... nothing interesting. If we get set Remember me on we get the same request. Lets check our cookies.",
    "This is a JWT token. A JWT is separated into three parts. The first is called a header and is being used for general information like the token type and algorithm, the second part is the payload (the info we want to store) and the last one iS the signature which makes sure the token is valid. All the tokens parts are separated by a dot and are encoded in based64. Lets decode it.",
    "We have a role part that is set to user. So we can just change it to admin and hippity hoppity your site is my property? Hell no.",
    "Doing that the signature will become invalid and you will just be logged out.",
    "So what can we do? lets take a look at the token again. We can see that the token is holding the algorithm it used to verify itself on itself. It means that we can change the algorithm to none, and the token will just check for none algorithm on the signature.",
    "So lets do it, first lets change the header. Do the same for the payload (make sure you change it to admin), then add the header and the payload together separated by a dot and also add another dot at the end and dont add a signature at all.",
    "Just change the cookie and refresh, it will now log you as an admin!"
