Title: SQL Injection in Login Functionality

During a CTF competition, I encountered a web application that allowed users to login to a protected area by submitting their credentials through a login form. Given the potential security risks associated with login functionality, I suspected that the application might be vulnerable to SQL Injection, a type of vulnerability that allows attackers to inject and execute malicious SQL commands in the application's database.

To test for SQL Injection, I crafted a malicious input containing SQL commands, such as 1' or '1'='1, and submitted it to the application's login form. If the application allowed the input to execute and bypass the login authentication, it would confirm the presence of an SQL Injection vulnerability.

Upon submitting the crafted input to the application, it indeed executed the SQL command and bypassed the login authentication, confirming the vulnerability. To obtain the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge, I needed to use the SQL Injection vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the application's database.

After researching the database's structure and available data, I crafted a suitable payload containing SQL commands to extract the desired information and submitted it to the application's login form. The server successfully executed the commands and displayed the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge.

This CTF writeup highlights the importance of properly securing web applications against SQL Injection vulnerabilities by validating and sanitizing user input, using parameterized queries, and implementing input/output encoding. By exploiting the SQL Injection vulnerability, I was able to inject and execute malicious SQL commands, bypass authentication, extract sensitive information, and obtain the flag needed to complete the challenge.
