<h2>Challenge</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>0xeax developed the codeiiest website and hid the flag somewhere.</p>
  
  <p>It is the most beautiful website I have ever seen on this planet. Why don't you visit the website and get me the flag?</p>
  
  <p>Challenge running at : <a href="https://codeiiest.github.io">https://codeiiest.github.io</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>In the home page of the website there is the following HTML comment at the end.</p>

<p>```html
<!-- Here's the first part of flag for You.  -->
<!-- part1 
accessdenied{1<em>w3nt</em>thr0ug --></p>

<p><!-- rest part of flag is in d4rks0c1ety page -->
```</p>

<p>On the other page, i.e. <a href="https://codeiiest.github.io/d4rks0c1ety.html">https://codeiiest.github.io/d4rks0c1ety.html</a>, you can find another HTML comment at the beginning.</p>

<p>```html
<!-- part 2 of the flag is -->
<!-- 
        h<em>th1s</em>w3bs1t3} 
--></p>

<p><!-- Thanks for your time. -->
```</p>

<p>So the flag is the following:</p>

<p><code>
accessdenied{1_w3nt_thr0ugh_th1s_w3bs1t3}
</code></p>
