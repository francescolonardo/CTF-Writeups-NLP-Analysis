Title: Uncovering Hidden Flags through JavaScript Deobfuscation
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: JavaScript Deobfuscation
Tools used: JavaScript Beautifier
Keywords: obfuscation, flag, Base64, function

#overview
This CTF writeup describes how I discovered a web application that used heavily obfuscated JavaScript code to perform client-side operations. I suspected that the obfuscation was hiding sensitive information, such as the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge. To analyze the obfuscated code, I used various deobfuscation techniques and tools, such as JavaScript Beautifier, to make the code more readable.

#analysis
As I carefully examined the deobfuscated code, I identified several interesting functions and variables that seemed to be related to the flag. I discovered that the flag was split into multiple parts and scattered throughout the JavaScript code. Each part of the flag was encoded or obfuscated in a different way, such as being Base64 encoded or hidden within a complex function.

#attack_execution
To reconstruct the complete flag, I decoded and extracted each part of the flag from the JavaScript code. After combining all the parts, I obtained the full flag needed to complete the Web Exploitation challenge. This CTF writeup highlights the importance of thoroughly examining client-side code in web applications, as sensitive information may be hidden within obfuscated JavaScript files.
