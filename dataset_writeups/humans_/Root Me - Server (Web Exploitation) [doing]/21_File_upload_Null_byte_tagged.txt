Title: Renaming a Shell to Bypass File Upload Restrictions
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: File Upload Restrictions
Tools used: None
Keywords: nullbyte

#context
Passing this level is super easy. Use the same shell as before.

#exploitation
Say the file name of your shell is shell.php. Rename it to shell.php%00.jpg. When submitted, the .jpg file extension will be dropped due to the preceding nullbyte. Once the file has uploaded, click it.

#countermeasures
This challenge demonstrates the importance of properly validating file extensions and content types during file uploads. Developers should also consider implementing additional security measures, such as file size limits and virus scanning, to prevent malicious files from being uploaded to their web applications.
