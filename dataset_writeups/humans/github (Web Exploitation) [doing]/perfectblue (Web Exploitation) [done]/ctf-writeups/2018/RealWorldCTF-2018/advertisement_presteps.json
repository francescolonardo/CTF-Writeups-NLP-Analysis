    "Started the CTF challenge with a note stating 'under protection' indicating the platform has some security measures",
    "Suspected it had something to due with security protections such as a WAF after noting the title 'advertisement' and the presence of protected DIG records",
    "Suspected it could be related to Cloudflare protections after examining DIG records",
    "Considered triggering a custom Cloudflare error, but didn't know how to do it",
    "Recalled an example from a known website (crunchyroll.com) where a Cloudflare error was triggered by SQL injection",
    "Tried using an SQL injection on the challenge platform (inputting ' OR 1=1--')",
    "Received a custom error with the flag as a response, resulting in successful completion of the challenge"
