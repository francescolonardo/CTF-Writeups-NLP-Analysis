The website allows to upload a file. Analyzing the HTML you can discover an interesting comment containing a PHP snippet.

The website returns you a link to the uploaded file, it renames the file with a random value preserving the extension. So, a PHP shell can be uploaded and visited executing its content.

Unfortunately the RCE doesn't work, but the text says: 'maybe some info will help you'.

So you can try to understand what's happening using `phpinfo()`.

Some functions are disabled, you can see them under `disable_functions` section of `phpinfo()` output.

`scandir` and `file_get_contents` are not disabled and the flag is under `/etc`.

A simple exploit.php can be created and uploaded.

[PHP code that reads the contents of every file in the "/etc/" directory and outputs the contents of any file that contains the string "darkCON{". It also outputs information about the PHP environment using the "phpinfo()" function.]

The exploit output will contains the flag.
