    "Started with examining the Dockerfile provided",
    "Identified a misconfiguration in the `apache.conf` file",
    "Noticed that `<Directory />` is incorrectly set to refer to the filesystem directory and not the web root",
    "Recognized this configuration grants access to any file on the filesystem",
    "Checked server responses to identify Apache server version (2.4.49)",
    "Acknowledged this version is vulnerable to a recent path traversal zero-day",
    "Executed a GET request `GET /cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/flag.txt HTTP/1.1` to exploit this vulnerability",
    "Retrieved the flag at `/flag.txt`"
