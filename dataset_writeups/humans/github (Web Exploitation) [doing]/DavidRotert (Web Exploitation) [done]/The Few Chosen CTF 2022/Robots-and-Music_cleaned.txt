The App consists only of a web page displaying "I hope you loke robots!. Other paths do not work and they always display the same HTML with the `200 OK` status code.

Because the challenge is called "Robots and Music" and the text says "I hope you like robots!" I tried opening `robots.txt`, and it disallowed the path `/g00d_old_mus1c.php`.

Opening the page reveals the flag.
