    "Recognized that the challenge name and challenge statement hinted at SQL injection",
    "Visited the webpage which had an authentication form",
    "Found an interesting comment in the HTML source code: '?sauce'",
    "Accessed a new webpage 'http://challs.houseplant.riceteacatpanda.wtf:30001/?sauce'",
    "Saw the webpage's source code, which is PHP",
    "Noticed that the PHP code showed that 'flagman69' username would output the flag",
    "Identified that the webpage is vulnerable to SQL injection as the query in the PHP code was concatenating user input directly",
    "Identified additional control which prevents SQL injection if password contains the number '1'",
    "Tried to bypass password check with SQL injection but found that the flag did not print even though the login was successful",
    "Identified that the webpage might not have the 'flagman69' user",
    "Tried using the 'UNION' clause in the SQL injection to search for the 'flagman69' user",
    "Found that the 'users' table had 3 columns and the second column contained the usernames",
    "Crafted a new SQL injection that directly passed 'flagman69' as the username column value using the 'UNION' clause",
    "Used the new SQL injection, got authenticated as 'flagman69' and received the flag."
