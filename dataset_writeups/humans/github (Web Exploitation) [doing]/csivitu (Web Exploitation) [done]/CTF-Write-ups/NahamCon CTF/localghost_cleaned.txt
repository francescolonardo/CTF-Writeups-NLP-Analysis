Well, if you happen to look at the local storage, you'll get the flag directly. But that's not how we got it because we're stupid. So, here's what we did.

You see a JS file in the sources: `jquery.jscroll2.js`. Now, to understand what exactly it does, we first convert the huge list on `line 1` from `hex` to `string` to be able to make sense of it. So let's convert it using a script written in `python2`.

Once you convert it, you will see some meaningful strings such as `localStorage`, `setItem`, `data`, `defaults`, `extend`, `function`, etc..

Now we can try to make sense of the rest of the code. We see a line:
```javascript
window[_0xbcec[8]][_0xbcec[7]](_0xbcec[5], atob(_0xbcec[6]));
```

Now that we have the strings figured out, we can translate this to:
```javascript
window['localstorage']['setItem']('flag', atob('SkNURntzcG9vb29va3lfZ2hvc3RzX2luX3N0b3JhZ2V9'))
```

So the script basically converst the `base64` string `SkNURntzcG9vb29va3lfZ2hvc3RzX2luX3N0b3JhZ2V9` and stores it in local storage with the key `flag`. Well, now you can just check the local storage, or just convert this string to ASCII using BASH.
