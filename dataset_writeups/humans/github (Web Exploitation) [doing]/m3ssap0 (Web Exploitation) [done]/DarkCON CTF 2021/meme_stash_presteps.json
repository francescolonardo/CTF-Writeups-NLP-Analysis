    "Performed basic web enumeration to identify the presence of a Git repository in the target URL (http://meme-stash.darkarmy.xyz/)",
    "Used the tool 'git-dumper' to extract and download all the contents of the Git repository from the website",
    "Inspected the 'git log' to view all previous commits in the repository",
    "Identified a suspicious commit with a message 'oops', indicating the possibility of useful information in previous commits",
    "Expected to find the flag before the suspicious commit and used 'git diff' command to check differences between that commit and its preceding commit",
    "From the 'git diff' command output, recognized prior presence of a file named 'flag.jpg' which was later removed",
    "Restored the repository to the previous commit that contained the flag ('flag.jpg') using 'git checkout' command",
    "Found the flag file 'flag.jpg' in the checkout version of the repository. The flag was 'darkCON{g1t_d4_fl4g}'"
