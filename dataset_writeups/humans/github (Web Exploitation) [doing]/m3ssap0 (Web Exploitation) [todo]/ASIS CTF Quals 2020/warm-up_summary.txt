Analyze the PHP code on the target website, which includes an `eval` execution over the "warmup" GET parameter.

Identify the strict checks on the "warmup" parameter and determine that direct function invocation is not possible.

Research techniques to bypass such checks and find two relevant resources: "Bypass WAF - Php webshell without numbers and letters" and "`preg_match` Code Execution."

Use the second resource to craft a payload, creating a variable with a non-alphanumeric name and assigning it the string "GET" using a bitwise XOR operation in PHP.

Specify the execution of the content of a GET parameter using PHP code.

Combine the code snippets to create a complete payload that, when executed by the `eval` instruction, retrieves the flag.

Execute the attack with the crafted payload, obtaining the flag as a result.
