<h1>PHP Eval White-List</h1>

<h2>re/web</h2>

<p>This time, we have a website that evals our stuff. At first I was pretty sad because the program blocked me from going up directories and stuff due to the basedir. After working on other problems for a bit, I came back to this one with a fresh start. Opening the source and looking at strings, I found that <code>shell_exec</code> was mentioned. I took a blind guess that this meant <code>shell_exec</code> was allowed (it probably didn't). Thus I ran <code>echo shell_exec("../flag");</code>. Somehow, it worked.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure this problem was misconfigured.</p>
