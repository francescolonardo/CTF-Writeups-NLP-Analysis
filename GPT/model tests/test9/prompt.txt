Generate a comprehensive attack model from a CTF writeup, elucidating the attacker's thought process leading to their solution. 
Strive for maximal abstraction to create a generic attack model independent of the specific writeup.
Use the following JSON format as a guide:
```json

    "AttackModel": {
        "AttackerCapabilities": [
            "List the capabilities or skills possessed by the attacker."
        ],

            ],
            "SecurityMeasures": [
                "List the security measures or configurations of the target. If no SecurityMeasures are mentioned, do not include this field."
