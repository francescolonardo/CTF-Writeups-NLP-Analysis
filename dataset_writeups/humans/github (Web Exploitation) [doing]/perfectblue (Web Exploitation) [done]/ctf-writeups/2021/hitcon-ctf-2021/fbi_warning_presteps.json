    "Observed a post message which mentions an FBI DB dump at https://tinyurl.com/fbi-hack and contains a tripcode",
    "Researching online, find that the tripcode is generated from a snippet of futaba-ng code",
    "From the code snippet, learn that the tripcode is a part of an encrypted string composed of remote IP address, a seed (IDSEED), and current date",
    "Set IDSEED with 'id\u306e\u7a2e' as given in the code",
    "Infer that IP address has prefix 219 as suggested by the hint and tripcode is 'ueyUrcwA'",
    "Assuming the posting date as the current date, write a PHP script that brute force all possible remaining octets of the IP address within the range of 0 to 256",
    "In the script, generate a tripcode for each possible IP and compare it with the target",
    "Run the brute force PHP script",
    "When the correct tripcodes match, retrieve the corresponding IP address and form the flag"
