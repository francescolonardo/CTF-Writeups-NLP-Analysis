Visit the website that allows using the cowsay command and creating custom cowfiles.
Assume that the custom cowfile format appends the string passed to the cow designer functionality after the `$the_cow` variable.
Attempt to modify the content of the cowfile with Perl code that lists files in the current directory.
Replace the `A` letter placeholder with `\n` (`0x0a`) using a proxy, and use only variables already defined in the Perl script, such as `$eyes`.
Send an HTTP request to enumerate the directory content.
Send another HTTP request to print the contents of the flag file.
