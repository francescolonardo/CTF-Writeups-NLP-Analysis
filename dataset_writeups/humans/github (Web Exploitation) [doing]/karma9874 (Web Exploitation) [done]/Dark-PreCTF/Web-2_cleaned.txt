On opening the link we see a login form, log in with any junk user and pass we get redirected to `/flag` which says `Not admin, no flag for you` hmmm...

On checking cookies we see there is key `token` with some value which is JWT again xD, checking it on [jwt.io] get this

The token is using RS256 algorithm which means it needs a private key and a public key 

On accessing `/robots.txt` and a little bit of scrolling xD we see there is some PRIVATE KEY.

So we have the private key now then we can build a token and apply the signature to it. I used nodejs `jsonwebtoken` library to do this stuff:
[Node.js script: Sign JWT token with private key]

Now access the `/flag` using the token as cookie and we get the flag

The bug in this challenge was that the private key was not properly hidden.
