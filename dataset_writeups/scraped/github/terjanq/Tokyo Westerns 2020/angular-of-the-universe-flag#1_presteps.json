    "Bypassed the Angular application that was set up behind Nginx reverse proxy.",
    "Accessed '/debug/answer' endpoint which was restricted both by nginx and the application.",

    "Discovered another way to solve the challenge for the second flag by injecting '\\debug\\answer' as the host in a curl request.",
    "Confirmed that when Angular tries to match up the path, it parses the URL created from 'PROTOCOL + HOST + PATH'."
