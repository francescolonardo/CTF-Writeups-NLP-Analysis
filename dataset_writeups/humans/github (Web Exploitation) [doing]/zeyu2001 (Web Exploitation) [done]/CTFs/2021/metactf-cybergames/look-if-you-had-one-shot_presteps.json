    "Identify that the 'login_session_token' is used when making a query to 'mfa_service.php'.",
    "Discover that there is no limit to the number of attempts made with the same token, as long as correct CAPTCHA code is provided.",
    "Perform batching in GraphQL to send multiple queries at once, with the anticipation that the server will process all queries together using the same CAPTCHA code.",
    "Successfully use the same CAPTCHA code to test two different MFA tokens by sending them both in the same HTTP request.",
    "Understand that MFA token is only 4 digits and take advantage of this limited search space by sending batches of thousands of queries together, thereby reducing the number of required CAPTCHA responses.",
    "Observe that due to request length limits around 3000 queries are batched at a time.",
    "Write script to automate this process of generating payloads and making POST requests.",
    "Note that every 3000 attempts, the CAPTCHA code needs to be updated manually in the script.",
