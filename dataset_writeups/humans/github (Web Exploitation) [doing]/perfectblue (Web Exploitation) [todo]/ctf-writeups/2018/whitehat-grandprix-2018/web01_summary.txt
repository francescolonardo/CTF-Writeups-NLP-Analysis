Given a simple server in Python that only handles GET and POST requests with files, the vulnerability was suspected to be directory traversal in either GET path handling or POST filename.
Debug prints confirmed directory traversal in POST filename, and a crafted POST request was used to write a file 'lol.txt' in the root directory with the content "hacked".
Based on the challenge description, it was determined that overwriting `.bashrc` was the target, as user `manhndd` SSH-es in every minute.
Since there was no way to exfiltrate the flag directly, the flag was read from `/var/secret` and written to `/opt/mydank`, the web-facing directory.
To win the race against other players, the crafted request was spammed in Burp's repeater, and a Python script was used to read from `/mydank` until the flag was obtained.
