    "Identify the source code of the web application with registration, login, and readfile functionalities",
    "Login to get a token using that token to readfile and read the `68696e742e747874` (hex decoded as hint.txt)",
    "Identify hint from the response suggesting length extension attack with password length less than 30 characters",
    "Identify that the web application is running on node.js and that `package.json` should be present on the system",
    "Use hashpumpy function to get the contents of package.json and establish that the password length is `22`",
    "Find that `node-serialize` is used in User.js for creating the user-specific `token` and that the npm package is vulnerable to node-deserialization RCE attack ",
    "Identify that the application verifies the token and then forwards it to `decrypter` function which calls the `unserialize` function, which can provide Remote Code Execution (RCE)",
    "Identify that to exploit RCE, payload needs to be signed with a valid signature which can be obtained from .env file",
    "Read .env file to get the AUTH_SECRET value",
    "Create a Python script to exploit the vulnerability and get Remote Code Execution (RCE)",
    "Use the exploit to read the /etc/flag.txt file and obtain the flag"
