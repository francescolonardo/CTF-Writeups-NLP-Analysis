    "Read the challenge description and requirements, the vulnerability lies in Express query parsing",
    "Study source files, specifically server.js",
    "Identify that files retrieved need to pass certain conditions: no spaces or slashes in filename, filename length five or less, and only js, ts, cpp, c files allowed",
    "Infer that the flag is inside a `flag.txt`, needing to bypass filename restrictions to get it",
    "Note that when an array is passed in 'file' GET parameter, it gets converted and concatenated into a string with comma separation for each element. This also passes the filename restrictions",
    "Note that '.' and 'js' have to be the last two elements of the array to pass the file type check",
    "Construct a parameter that both meets the conditions and requests the flag file. `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', '/../flag.txt', '.', 'js']` is passed in an array via the GET parameter so that only the first five elements are used to create the file name, which then resolves to `flag.txt` after the process",
    "Send the GET request `/getFile?file[]=a&file[]=b&file[]=c&file[]=d&file[]=/../flag.txt&file[]=.&file[]=js` to the server",
    "Retrieve the flag from the server response: `csictf{5h0uld_5tr1ng1fy_th3_p4r4ms}`"
