In this one we land on a support page where we can send a POST request, it also contains a backend button which takes us to a login page…

first I thought its a cookie stealing challenge so I send the following payload : 

and I got a JWT : 

decoded :

and I got two interesting things here, now the cookie did not work for login for some reason so I went back to enum and found an API endpoint :

using XHR I sent the following request to change the password :

logged in with the new password :

but moderator doesn’t have the flag so I had to escalate to admin…

using the same payload above I just changed the `uid` from 100 to 1 and logged in again, I could have got it one go but well…
