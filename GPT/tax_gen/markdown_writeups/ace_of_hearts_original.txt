<p>We had a image gallery here with 4 user galleries. </p>

<p>Sarah’s gallery
John’s gallery
Ripley’s gallery
Ash’s gallery</p>

<p>John’s gallery was not accessible, set to private.</p>

<p>When querying any other gallery, we could see the URL changing like so:</p>

<p><code>
http://172.17.15.117:20011/gallery?galleryUrl=/admin
</code></p>

<p>I tried to call the admin gallery through local-host and got access to the admin panel, where I just had to untick a box for making John’s gallery public.</p>

<p><code>
http://172.17.15.117:20011/gallery?galleryUrl=http://127.0.0.1:20011/admin
</code></p>

<p>He had this flag inside:</p>
