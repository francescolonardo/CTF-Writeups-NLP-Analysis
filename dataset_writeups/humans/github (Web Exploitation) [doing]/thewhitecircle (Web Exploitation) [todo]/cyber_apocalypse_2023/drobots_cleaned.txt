Pandora's latest mission as part of her reconnaissance training is to infiltrate the Drobots firm that was suspected of engaging in illegal activities. Can you help pandora with this task?

In this challenge the website is showing a login page.

Since no other info was there or in the source code of the page I checked the docker config file.

The website is a `Flask` application running on `MySQL` so I thought of SQL Injection cand be done. Here I found interesting thing that in `config.py` file they have provided the database information.

Also in the `database.py` also they have given the hint that the input is not sanitized. 
The logic of the database is that we need the `token` of the password to login. So if we can find the token we can login.

Then I saved the login request and gave it to `sqlmap` though which I was able to extract the details.

Once logged in we get the flag.
