    "Identified HAProxy configuration protecting the '/flag' endpoint as case sensitive",
    "Requested '/FLAG' endpoint instead of '/flag' to bypass the validation and obtained the flag",
    "Realized an intended solution involved exploiting a HTTP request smuggling vulnerability in HAProxy version 2.4.0",
    "Executed a POST request with an overflowing 'Content-Length' header and a second 'Content-Length' header with a value of 26",
    "Included 'GET /flag HTTP/1.1' and a dummy value as the request body which fooled HAProxy into treating it as part of the first request.",
    "A second dummy 'GET / HTTP/1.1' request was placed after which was treated as a separate request by HAProxy",
    "The requests after reaching the backend server were modified such that the first request had 'Content-Length: 0' and the second request was 'GET /flag HTTP/1.1' as intended initially",
    "The response for the second consequent request corresponded to '/flag' instead of '/' due to the request smuggling",
    "Incorporated delays between consecutive requests to account for pipelining in the server",
    "Sent the specially constructed requests to the server and obtained the flag in the response of the smuggled request."
