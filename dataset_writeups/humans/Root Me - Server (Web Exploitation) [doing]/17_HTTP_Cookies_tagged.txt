Title: Solving a Web Server Challenge
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: None
Tools used: Firefox, Live HTTP Headers
Keywords: cookie, admin access

#context
This challenge really irritated me because it took me 3 different plugins to find one that would work. Once I did, solving the challenge is a no-brainer.

#discovery
Click on saved email addresses, we get an error that says we must be admin. Checking the url: http://challenge01.root-me.org/web-serveur/ch7/?c=visiteur. But simply replacing visiteur with admin we get an error that says theres an issue with the cookie value.

#discovery
Install the firefox plugin Live HTTP Headers and click the Saved email addresses link again. In live http headers, you can see the cookie: ch7=visiteur.

#exploitation
Click replay and change visiteur to admin, then replay again. In the browser click the link once more to find the validation password.

#countermeasures
None

#code
None
