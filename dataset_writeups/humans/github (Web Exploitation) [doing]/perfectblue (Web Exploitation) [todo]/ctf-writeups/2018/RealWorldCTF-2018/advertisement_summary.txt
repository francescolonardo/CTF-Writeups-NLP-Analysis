Initially struggled with the problem, spending time looking at DIG records.
Noticed the problem's title and the mention of "under protection," suspected it had to do with WAFs, possibly Cloudflare.
Recalled that SQL injection on another site caused a custom Cloudflare error.
Performed an SQL injection on the target site (`' OR 1=1--'`).
Obtained a custom error containing the flag directly.
