GETS Request

Solved By : thewhiteh4t


The challenge hints at memory issues
we can enter an integer and the web app sends a reply
there are few checks which the web app makes:

javascript
if(!req.query.n) {
    res.status(400).send('Missing required parameter n');
    return;
}

* so n cannot be blank
```javascript
const BUFFER_SIZE = 8;
if(req.query.n.length > BUFFER_SIZE) {
    res.status(400).send('Requested n too large!');
    return;
}
```

so max length of n can be 8
the web app does not check for duplicate parameters, so we can send another n along with the first
