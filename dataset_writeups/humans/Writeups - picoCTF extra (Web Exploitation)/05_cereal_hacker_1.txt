It will be foundamental later. After a ton of guessing and a little hint from the official discord page of picoCTF we found that the credentials to log in as a regular user were: username=guest and password=guest
The really intresting part in this page are the cookies, in fact there is a new cookie base64 encoded called user_info

# Analysis
After decoding it I found out that it was serialized code (Click [here]() if you want to know more about serialization in php)
So after a little bit of tries I tried with an sql injection in the password field ant it worked!!

# Attack Execution
And after sending it as a cookie in the admin page, it returned the flag
