Observe that the `data` parameter in the URL looks suspicious during the purchase process.
Analyze the `data` contents during successful purchases of `cheap` and failed purchases of `flag`.
Notice that the successful purchases share the same prefix and the suffixes of `c1` and `cp1` are the same, likely containing product name and purchase status information.
Attempt to decode the `data` contents without success.
Create a Python script to brute-force the prefix by trying various combinations of the data from failed and successful purchases.
Obtain the flag URL using the brute-forced prefix.
