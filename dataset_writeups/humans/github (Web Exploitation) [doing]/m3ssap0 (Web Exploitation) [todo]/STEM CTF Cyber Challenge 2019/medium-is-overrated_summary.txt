Write a bash script to reproduce the repository locally, recreating the `index.php` file and the `noIdeaWhatImDoing` file.
Analyze the history with `bzr log` and `bzr diff` to discover important modifications to `index.php`.
Modify the initial script to identify all important differences on `index.php`.
Find two differences: a base64 encoded password for a Bitcoin wallet and an hexadecimal string.
Treat the hexadecimal string as the AES ECB key to decode the Bitcoin wallet password.
Use OpenSSL to decode the password and obtain the flag.
