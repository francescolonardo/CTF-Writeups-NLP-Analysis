Title: Broken Authentication and Session Management Attack
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: Broken Authentication and Session Management
Tools used: None
Keywords: user authentication, session management, vulnerability, payload, tampered session ID, hijack session, secure session management, authentication controls, user input validation

#overview
During a CTF competition, the author encountered a web application that allowed users to login and manage their profiles. Suspecting a Broken Authentication and Session Management vulnerability, the author crafted a malicious payload to test the application's security.

#analysis
To test for the vulnerability, the author submitted a tampered session ID payload to the application's login form. The payload executed and bypassed the authentication process, confirming the vulnerability. To obtain the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge, the author needed to use the vulnerability to hijack the session of a logged-in user.

After researching the application's session management and cookie handling, the author crafted a suitable payload containing a tampered session ID that would hijack the session of a logged-in user. The server recognized the payload and responded with the session of the logged-in user.

#attack_execution
By exploiting the vulnerability, the author was able to bypass authentication, hijack user sessions, and complete the Web Exploitation challenge.
