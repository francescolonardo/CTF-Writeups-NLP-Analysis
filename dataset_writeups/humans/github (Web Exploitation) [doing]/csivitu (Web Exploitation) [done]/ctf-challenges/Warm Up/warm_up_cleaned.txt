In this challenge, you can see the `index.php` code by default.

So, you see that we have to match the value of `hash` and `target`. It is checked that the `hash` param does not equal `10932435112`, but again it checks that the sha1 hash of `hash` is equal to that of `10932435112`. We know that the sha1 hashes will not match ever, so it's not a bruteforce challenge. Later, you notice that the `$hash` and the `$target` and matched using `==` and not `====`. `==` is vulnerable to type juggling!

If you see the hash of `10932435112`, it starts with `0e...`. So any other hash which starts with `0e` will match this with `==`, since `==` does not check types, so these will be treated as numbers. So, you have to bruteforce considerably lesser amount of values. 

You would find a lot of matches.

Pass any of these with the GET param `hash`, and you get the flag.
