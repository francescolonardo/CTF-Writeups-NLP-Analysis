I'll provide you with some context.
Assume I am tasked with creating a taxonomy to categorize a set of actions taken from web application CTF writeups.

So I'll send you a list of sub-categories.
Try to merge all the following sub-categories, reducing overlapping and avoiding redundancies.
Provide me with a taxonomy, with two levels of depth, with the intention of using them later for labelling the actions taken by attackers in the CTF writeups of web applications.

In this specific case, the goal is to merge th sub-categories of the "{category}" category, whose description is as follows:
`{description}`

I would like a response in the format of a numbered list of sub-categories based on the aforementioned category.
Additionally, within each sub-category, I would like a bullet-pointed list that breaks them down into further sub-sub-categories.
Return in response just that, ensuring no additional content or remarks are added.
