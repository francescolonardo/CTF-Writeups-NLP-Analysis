The code at authentication.js is obfuscated.

The initial array contains base64 encoded strings.

Decoding them, you will obtain an array with some that contains these elements: 'Make a GET request to /hidden/nextstep.php','includes','length','log'

So you can discover another endpoint: nextstep.php to contact.

The HTTP response contains a ROT13 encrypted message in HTTP headers that can be easily decrypted and says: 'Make a POST request to /api/final.php'

Performing the `POST` request you will get the following answer: 'Send a post setting the variable flag'

Changing the `POST` request with a `flag` variable set will give you the flag.
