The challenge gives you an HTML file which connects to a Firestore environment.

[HTML code containing a webpage with a canvas element, two columns of input fields and buttons, and a script to send and receive data to/from a Firebase database.]

The application allows you to color pixels on a canvas shared with other users, storing data into Firestore repository.

To interact with Firebase installation you can use the browser console.

Analyzing the client source code and reading the official documentation, you can discover that data of a document can be retrieved with the following snippet.

[JavaScript code that retrieves a document named "data" from a collection named "board" in a database, checks if it exists, and logs the retrieved data or an error message to the console.]

The retrieved data will be a structure with all the RGB values for pixels.

You can try a document called `flag`.

[JavaScript code that retrieves a document from a Firestore database collection named "board" and with a document ID of "flag". If the document exists, it logs the document data to the console; otherwise, it logs "No such document!". If an error occurs while retrieving the document, it logs the error to the console.]

And you will get the flag.
