The website simulates a chat with a VIP. Analyzing the HTML, some interesting JavaScript code can be found.

Peforming some tests, you can discover that chat functionality is vulnerable to HTML tag injection, because the message sent to the server is then reflected into the web page and it is not escaped. An XSS can be performed using the `img` tag and the `onerror` attribute.

Analyzing cookies, an interesting cookie called `secret` can be found, but it is set to `none` value.

A listening server can be set up using netcat.

The following HTTP request can be crafted to attack the chat endpoint and steal cookies of the VIP user.

On the listening server you will find the request sent by the victim browser.

The `secret` cookie will contain the flag.
