#context
No matter what credentials we use for the login, it successfully logs us in, but doesn't give us the flag. 

#discovery
This suggests that a cookie might be used to store a separate variable that might be preventing us from seeing the flag.
We open the cookie and we notice an admin variable set to False.

#exploitation
Changing this to True and refreshing the page gives us the flag.
