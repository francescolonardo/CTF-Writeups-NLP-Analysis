        "requirements_substeps": "Refine the given attack model by breaking down each step into individual actions, when applicable. For every main step, create a \"Substeps\" list. If a step cannot be further broken down, use the original \"StepString\" as the single \"SubstepString\" within the \"Substeps\" list. It's imperative that the \"StepString\" values remain unchanged. Example INPUT: ``` { \"AttackModel\": { \"Steps\": [ { \"StepNumber\": 1, \"StepString\": \"Visited the website and got redirected to '/?file=wc.php'\" }, { \"StepNumber\": 2, \"StepString\": \"Realized 'echo exec(...)' only returns the last line of the output\" }, ... ] } } ``` Corresponding example OUTPUT: ``` { \"AttackModel\": { \"Steps\": [ { \"StepNumber\": 1, \"StepString\": \"Visited the website and got redirected to '/?file=wc.php'\", \"Substeps\": [ { \"SubstepNumber\": 1.1, \"SubstepString\": \"Visited the website.\" }, { \"SubstepNumber\": 1.2, \"SubstepString\": \"Observed redirection to '/?file=wc.php'.\" } ] }, { \"StepNumber\": 2, \"StepString\": \"Realized 'echo exec(...)' only returns the last line of the output\", \"Substeps\": [ { \"SubstepNumber\": 2.1, \"SubstepString\": \"Realized 'echo exec(...)' only returns the last line of the output.\" } ] }, ... ] } } ``` Return in response just the refined JSON, ensuring no additional content or remarks are added.

        "requirements_taxl1": "Given the input JSON provided, please label each substep. For each substep, assign the most appropriate category name to the 'Tier1TaxonomyMain' field from the list of 12 available categories. For the 'Tier1TaxonomyAlternative' field, select the second most appropriate category from the list of 12 available categories. If you're confident about the first category choice, use \"N/A\" for the 'Tier1TaxonomyAlternative' field's value.
