    "Analyzed the secure portal page source",
    "Deciphered that the JavaScript in the source code was obfuscated",
    "Noted that the password for the portal is being checked by the script",
    "Translated the hex-encoded list, var _0x575c, into a more readable format",
    "Understood many calls to 'window' were made in the CheckPassword function, which essentially represented 'window.localStorage.setItem'",
    "Understood that the password was split into various parts and stored against assigned keys",
    "Used 'window.localStorage.getItem' similar to 'window[_0x4bbdc3[0x0]][_0x4bbdc3[0x1]]' to check our input password against the split parts",
    "Combined all password parts into a single string",
    "Entered the combined password into the portal"
