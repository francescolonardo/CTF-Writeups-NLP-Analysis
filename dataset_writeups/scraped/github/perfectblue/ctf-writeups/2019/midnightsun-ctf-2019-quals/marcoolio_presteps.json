    "Read the problem's given details and description, identified it's a Web category challenge, with a goal to perform an XSS attack and make a URL to trigger alert(1) for getting the flag",
    "Examined the provided source code which uses a markdown library to convert markdown into HTML, runs DOMPurify, and does some validation",
    "Noticed DOMPurify is applied on HTML, but acknowledged that DOMPurify is pretty secure, and it's unlikely they want me to find a vulnerability in it",
    "Saw a statement on DOMPurify's GitHub indicating that using the sanitized HTML with jQuery's insecure elm.html() method without the SAFE_FOR_JQUERY flag could lead to XSS",
    "Recognized from the source code that it is using jQuery's html() method without using the SAFE_FOR_JQUERY flag, hinting that XSS might be possible in this case",
    "Started looking for a payload to trigger the XSS, looked at the unit tests for the SAFE_FOR_JQUERY flag on the DOMPurify's GitHub",
    "Found a section in DOMPurify's unit tests where they tested payloads that can cause XSS if used with jQuery's html() method",
    "Tested payloads from the unit test in the challenge, the third payload ended up triggering an alert, indicating a successful XSS attack",
    "Created a URL with the successful payload and upon submitting it, received the flag"
