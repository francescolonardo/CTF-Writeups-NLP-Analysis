<ul>
<li>In this challenge we were given a website of a company</li>
<li>Two things which instantly caught attention were <code>URL Capture</code> and <code>Admin</code> buttons</li>
<li>URL capture service accepts a URL and takes screenshot of the webpage</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Admin page got a login</li>
<li>First idea was to try <code>http://localhost</code> and it worked</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>This is same as the loading splash screen I saw while loading the challenge website</li>
<li>Next I checked <code>robots.txt</code> and got 200 and this revealed a new path <code>/server-status</code></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Next I obviously tried to access <code>/server-status</code> and got 200 again</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>And in the logs you can see the login credentials!</li>
