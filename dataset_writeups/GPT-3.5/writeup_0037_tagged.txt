Title: SQL Injection in Login Form
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: SQL Injection
Tools used: None
Keywords: authentication, input validation, sanitization, prepared statements, stored procedures, sensitive data, user accounts, further attacks, countermeasures

#overview
During a CTF competition, I found a web application with a login form that had an SQL injection vulnerability. The application used user input directly in SQL queries without proper sanitization, which allowed me to inject malicious SQL code and bypass the authentication process.

#attack_execution
To exploit the vulnerability, I first identified the vulnerable input field and crafted a malicious SQL query. I then injected the query into the input field and submitted the form. The application executed the injected code, which granted me access to the authenticated area of the application.

#analysis
With access to the authenticated area, I was able to view sensitive data, modify user accounts, and launch further attacks against other systems. To mitigate this vulnerability, I recommended that the application implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques, and use prepared statements or stored procedures to execute SQL queries.

This CTF writeup highlights the importance of properly securing user input in SQL queries by implementing input validation and sanitization techniques and using prepared statements or stored procedures. By exploiting the vulnerability, I was able to demonstrate the potential risks associated with an SQL injection vulnerability in a login form and recommend proper countermeasures to prevent these types of attacks.
