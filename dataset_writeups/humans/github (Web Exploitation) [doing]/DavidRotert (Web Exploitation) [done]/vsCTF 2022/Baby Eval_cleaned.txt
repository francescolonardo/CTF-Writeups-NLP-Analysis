Baby Eval is a Node app which has a path `/` which lists some information including the server source code. As seen in the code the information comes from the following function:
[JavaScript function: Create a directory object with keys and values, including the server source code]

The webpage is created here:
[JavaScript code: Process and evaluate the payload from the query string]

The goal was to get the flag. First I saw that the code can execute `eval` by entering a `payload` as the `GET` query parameter. I first did not see that the ReEx is a Blacklist, not a whitelist (stupid me), so many things don't work including calling functions because `(` and `)` are not allowed. Then I googled for a way to call a function without prenthesis. Found that JavaScript Template Literals can have tags, which are basically functions whose first parameter is a list of strings. This list contains the parts of the string, split by the injection variables (`${x}`).

To bypass the restriction, I used the JavaScript Template Literal syntax to call the `directory` function with the argument "flag" by submitting the following payload.

Because we don't have an injection variable, the argument of `directory` is just `[ "flag" ]`.
