    "Identified Apache Traffic Server (ATS) 7.1.1 in the 'Server' response header",
    "Identified that ATS 7.1.1 is vulnerable to CVE-2018-8004, a request smuggling vulnerability due to a lack of validation for 'Content-Length' headers",
    "Identified that the server uses 'Content-Length' header even if 'Transfer-Encoding' header exists, leading to a request smuggling vulnerability",
    "Observed that a request to '/save.php' appends an entry to a log file containing the cookies and value of 'X-Access' header",
    "Assumed an admin visit to the site and constructed a CL-TE request smuggling attack to direct the admin to '/save.php'",
    "Crafted a payload using 'GET / HTTP/1.1' and the 'Content-Length' and 'Transfer-Encoding' headers",
    "Realized that the ATS server forwards the entire payload as a single request to the Nginx backend, while Nginx sees the 'Transfer-Encoding' header and considers the first request ended",
    "Noted that the second request 'GET /save.php HTTP/1.1' is not yet completed after the end of the first request",
    "Identified that when the admin visits the site (a third request), his request is appended to the incomplete second request, being processed as one single request",
    "Recognized that this single request contains the admin's 'Cookie' and 'X-Access' headers",
    "Viewed the admin's cookie and 'X-Access' headers in the log file",
    "Used these cookies to visit 'private.php' and obtain the flag."
