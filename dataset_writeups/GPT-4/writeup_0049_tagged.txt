Title: Server-Side Template Injection to Execute Arbitrary Commands
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: Server-Side Template Injection
Tools used: None
Keywords: SSTI, vulnerability, payload, sensitive data, flag, web application

#overview
During a CTF competition, I discovered a web application that allowed users to customize page content using templates. Suspecting that it could be vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI), I tested the application by submitting a benign template expression, such as {{ 7 * 7 }}. If the application evaluated the expression and displayed the result, it would confirm the presence of an SSTI vulnerability.

#analysis
The web application indeed evaluated the expression and displayed the result, confirming the vulnerability. To exploit the SSTI vulnerability and obtain the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge, I crafted a malicious template expression that would execute arbitrary commands on the server.

#attack_execution
After creating a suitable payload, I submitted it to the web application, which executed the commands, allowing me to access sensitive data, including the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge.

This CTF writeup highlights the importance of properly securing web applications against SSTI vulnerabilities by sanitizing user input and restricting the capabilities of server-side template engines. By exploiting the SSTI vulnerability, I was able to execute arbitrary commands on the server, access sensitive data, and obtain the flag needed to complete the challenge.
