When you look at the documentation for the source for the `flask_caching` module, you can optionally store a python pickle in the redis by prepending it with `'!'`. You can use python pickles for RCE, when the caching modules uses `pickle.load()` to load the cached data.

Set up a netcat listener on your server.

Run the following script with your IP and PORT:
[Python script: Create a payload for RCE and send it to the server]

On your netcat listener, you would get:
[HTTP POST request with the flag]
