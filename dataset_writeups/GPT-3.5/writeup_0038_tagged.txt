Title: XSS Attack on Contact Form
Primary topic: Web Exploitation
Secondary topic: Cross-Site Scripting
Tools used: None
Keywords: cookies, session, input validation, sanitization

#overview
During a CTF competition, I discovered a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in a contact form of a web application.

#analysis
The application allowed users to submit HTML code as part of the form, which was not properly sanitized, allowing me to inject malicious scripts.

To exploit the vulnerability, I crafted a script that would steal the user's cookies and send them to an external server. I then injected the script into the contact form and submitted it.

#attack_execution
When the application displayed the message containing the malicious script, it executed it in the user's browser, allowing me to steal their cookies and access their session.

With the user's session, I was able to perform various actions on their behalf, such as modifying their profile information, submitting orders, and accessing sensitive data.

To mitigate this vulnerability, I recommended that the application implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent XSS attacks.

This CTF writeup highlights the importance of properly securing user input in web applications by implementing input validation and sanitization techniques to prevent XSS attacks. By exploiting the vulnerability, I was able to demonstrate the potential risks associated with an XSS vulnerability in a contact form and recommend proper countermeasures to prevent these types of attacks.
