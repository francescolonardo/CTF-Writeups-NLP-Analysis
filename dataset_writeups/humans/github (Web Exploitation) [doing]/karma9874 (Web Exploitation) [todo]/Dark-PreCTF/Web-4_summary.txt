Log in with junk values, check cookies for the `token` key, and use jwt.io to analyze the token.
Find out the token uses the HS256 algorithm, which requires a secret_key for encryption.
Access `/robots.txt` but find no relevant information.
Deduce the challenge is related to brute-forcing the secret_key based on the description.
Use the jwt_tool with `rockyou.txt` to brute-force the secret_key, finding it as `redraider`.
Create a new HS256 JWT token with the secret_key redraider and the user set as admin.
Access the `/flag` route using the newly created token as a cookie to obtain the flag.
Recognize the challenge's bug: using a secret_key that could be easily brute-forced.
