    "The first step started by examining the cookies in the HTTP request and identifying a key called 'likeCookie' whose value was set to false.",
    "The value of 'likeCookie' was then changed to true which resulted in a response message suggesting the value could range from 1 to 20.",
    "A Python script was written to automate the process and test the different values for 'likeCookie' by making HTTP GET requests. The script uses the 'requests' library to send HTTP requests, and a for loop was used to iterate through the numbers from 1 to 20.",
    "The script sends a GET request to the target URL with each possible 'likeCookie' value (from 0 to 19). For each request, it checks if the response text contains 'LITCTF{' (indicating a CTF flag).",
    "Once the flag is found in a response, the script prints out the corresponding 'likeCookie' value and stops the loop.",
    "Executing this script provides the CTF flag hidden by the server on a specific 'likeCookie' value."
