The Challenge contains a python file,
On opening the python file u can clearly see som regex fu going on:

going through the code and testing it on the live link, u can see that it ignores the first letter if its upper case, and makes a logic around it. Its better if u view it in a debugging tool , I use regex101

I also went through the official documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) to see if there are any special characters that can be used. the most interesting one was `|`
As per the documentation:

Once u go through it with a `flag{randomString}` u will find that the following regex would allow it. 

So now we remove our initial regex and just add the ones we used aka `|flag{.*}|`
which gives u the flag
