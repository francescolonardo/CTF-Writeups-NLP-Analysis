Title: Server-Side Template Injection to Execute Arbitrary Commands

During a CTF competition, I stumbled upon a web application that allowed users to customize page content using templates. The way the application processed the templates made me suspect that it could be vulnerable to Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI), a type of vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious template expressions and execute arbitrary code on the server.

To test for SSTI, I crafted a benign template expression, such as {{ 7 * 7 }}, and submitted it to the application. If the application evaluated the expression and displayed the result, it would confirm the presence of an SSTI vulnerability.

Upon submitting the crafted input, the web application indeed evaluated the expression and displayed the result, confirming the vulnerability. To exploit the SSTI vulnerability and obtain the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge, I needed to craft a malicious template expression that would execute arbitrary commands on the server.

After creating a suitable payload, I submitted it to the web application, which executed the commands, allowing me to access sensitive data, including the flag for the Web Exploitation challenge.

This CTF writeup highlights the importance of properly securing web applications against SSTI vulnerabilities by sanitizing user input and restricting the capabilities of server-side template engines. By exploiting the SSTI vulnerability, I was able to execute arbitrary commands on the server, access sensitive data, and obtain the flag needed to complete the challenge.
