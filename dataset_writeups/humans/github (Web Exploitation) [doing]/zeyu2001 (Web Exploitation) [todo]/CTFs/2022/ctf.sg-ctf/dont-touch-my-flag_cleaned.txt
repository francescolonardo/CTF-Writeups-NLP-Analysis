This challenge consists of two servers - a proxy and a backend.

Let's take a look at how the proxy makes the request to the backend. The secret token is added to the cookies, and a user-controlled `uri` is joined to the backend URL using `urllib.parse.urljoin`.

But `urljoin` doesn't fare well when presented with a malformed path.

This allows us to get the proxy to make a request to our own server:

In the received request, we get the secret cookie.

Now we can send a request directly to the backend, which checks our secret before giving us the flag!
