    "Accessed the website which provides a functionality to create a custom cowfile via the following URL: `http://3.93.128.89:1204/cow_designer`. The cowfiles are script files that utilize the cowsay command to print messages.",
    "Devised a strategy to manipulate the content of the cowfile. Realized that the submitted string is appended after '$the_cow' variable in the script.",
    "Created a code snippet: `EOCA$eyes=`ls`;print '$eyes';` to potentially gain information about the directory. It was noted that the 'A' placeholder in the code has to be replaced with `\\n (`0x0a`) in a proxy.",
    "Sent an HTTP POST request to utilize the code snippet via the /cow_designer page to list the directory content. Discovered files in the directory, including the 'flag' file, amongst others.",
    "Created another Perl code snippet to read the contents of the file named 'flag'. The snippet (`EOC\n$eyes=`cat flag`;print '$eyes';`) was injected through another HTTP POST request to /cow_designer.",
    "Received the contents of the 'flag' file in the HTTP response, which contained the flag: `AOTW{th3_p3rl_c0w_s4ys_M0oO0o0O}`"
