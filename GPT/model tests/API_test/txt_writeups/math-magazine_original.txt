Solution
Connecting to the website you can see the following message.
```
Welcome!
This site is a math articles container.
At the moment you can only read your articles and write new ones.
Only admin can read other account articles, so pay attention what do you write :)
```
This website allows you to upload LaTeX documents and to list and view your uploaded ones. The view functionality doesn't escape/encode the output and the text field where you can write your LaTeX script doesn't sanitize the input; as a consequence, the website is vulnerable to XSS.
```latex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}

\end{document}
```
You can abuse this, in order to print administrator cookies, with the following payload.
```latex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}

\end{document}
```
When the article is submitted, the following output is shown.
```
WARN: Published, but admin cannot view you article :(
Error:
[] Going to visit url: http://10.255.0.1:8011/?p=articles&a=view&u_id=f2c41083389d45ee757cc8f65eb2afd4&id=11
[] Getting FLAG...
Alert Text: None
Message: unexpected alert open: {Alert text : PHPSESSID=aec0e26f10db41a5b584483bdc67dab1; FLAG=ptm{theflagisnothere}}
(Session info: headless chrome=75.0.3770.100)
```
But the flag is not the real one.
Analyzing the HTML, you can discover the following interesting comment.
html
<!--
    <li class="nav-item">
        (Not used anymore, but I left it here for historical reasons)
        <a class="nav-link" href="./src.zip">Source</a>
    </li>
-->

So you can download the src.zip file.
Analyzing the list source code, you can discover an interesting if statement, where the real flag is set into a cookie.
```php
COOKIE['FLAG']) && $COOKIE['FLAG'] === FALSEFLAG && $SESSION['SECRET'] === SECRET){
        setCookie('FLAG', FLAG, time() + 100, '/');
    }
$f = new ArticleFactory(USER);

?>
```
At this point you have already leaked the FALSE_FLAG, so you can force it into a cookie. You don't have SECRET value into your session, but you have the PHPSESSID of the administrator, so you can steal its session changing your cookie.
Crafting both cookies accordingly and accessing to the list functionality will give you the flag into the FLAG cookie.

Note: According to the challenge creator, the technique to leak PHPSESSID and false FLAG was not the intended one.
