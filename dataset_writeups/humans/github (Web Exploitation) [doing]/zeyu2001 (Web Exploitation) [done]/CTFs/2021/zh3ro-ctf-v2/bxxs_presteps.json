    "Given an endpoint that allows sending feedback in form of HTML. Initial attempts to supply URLs were futile.",
    "Discovered that arbitrary HTML submitted is rendered by the admin's browser. Verified this by submitting HTML enclosed in script tags to catch the HTTP request.",
    "Introduced three separate payloads in the HTML to obtain more information on the browsing context: one to get the full URL of the browsing context, another to get the page contents, and the third to get readable cookies.",
    "Extracted the page URL and learned that our submitted HTML was the only content present on the page. Also found that JavaScript couldn't read any cookies from the output of the payloads.",
    "Used the discovered page URL (`http://0.0.0.0/Secret_admin_cookie_panel`), received a `Set-Cookie` header from this page for a new cookie with HttpOnly flag set.",
    "Identified a `/flag` endpoint that had been inaccessible due to lack of the appropriate cookie.",
    "Revisited the page with the newly acquired 'admin' cookie, which allowed access to the `/flag` endpoint and revealed the flag."
