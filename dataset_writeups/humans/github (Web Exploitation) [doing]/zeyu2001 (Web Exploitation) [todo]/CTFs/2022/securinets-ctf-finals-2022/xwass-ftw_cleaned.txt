In this challenge, we have HTML injection through the `src=` parameter, but the CSP does not allow the loading of arbitrary scripts.

Thankfully, the following script is included in the response, which is permitted by the `nonce`.

We could therefore use the `<base>` tag to set the base URL of the document to our attacker-controlled site.

This will load the script `http://ATTACKER_URL/assets/js/bootstrap.js`, which we can host on our server:

The above payload will cause the browser to fetch `/?${document.cookie}`, which will be logged on our server, allowing us to get the admin's cookie.
